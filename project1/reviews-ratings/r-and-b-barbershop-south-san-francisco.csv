12/23/17,0.295684524,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I work for a group home of teenage boys and I've been searching for the best barbershop in the area for me to take them to. Since we found this place, this is the only place they seem to like coming to. They willingly take walk-ins which is a big thing for my group of boys as they are always on the go with sports and meetings. The man in the first chair, Ken, is always welcoming and respectful. Their customer service is A+ and makes my boys and I want to continue coming back. ""He's really chill"" -as one of the boys describe him. My boys are at the age where their appearance matters. It makes me feel good seeing how much more confident  (and handsome) my youth are after getting their haircut by Ken at R&R barbershop. And yes, he can cut ""black"" hair!! (Inside joke)"

12/1/17,0.441666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"There is a great set a guys in here. I came in without an appointment was able to still get some great service. Ken was my barber and he did great work. He listened to what I asked, and gave some advice. I don't usually do reviews but anything I can do to help these guys stay local."
5/30/17,0.264722222,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Very cool guys and definitely reputable barbers. Came in as a walk in and Derrick accepted me. Asked for a simple 1 and a half bald fade and he delivered. Great price and will be back.

9/20/17,0.336111111,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"So happy for Derrick and Austin on opening there own shop. Personally I have gotten cut by both, and both do an amazing job on their craft. Other than their skill to make you look ""fly"" for any occasion, both of their personalities blend together to set up a comfortable atmosphere in the shop. I have been getting cut by Derrick for the past 3 years now and have not been disappoint. I highly recommend R&B BARBERSHOP!"
5/13/17,-0.05,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,My barber couldn't come through so I tried these guys out and I couldn't believe the attention to detail. Not my usual barber but these dudes do a great job. Walk ins on Wednesdays and Saturday. The barber was on point just can't remember what he said his name was? (Chair by the window.) I will be back again as you saved me from horrible pictures at a wedding hahaha.

Come here to R&B Barbershop, hard working guys here early on the weekends to get YOU ready for your weekend, hang out with Derrick and Austin, and chill, be patient if you're coming early Saturday, cause people are always waiting for their turn, otherwise set up an appointment."

I sit on the chair, the guys gets a call on speaker scheduling people for later that day. I'm like wth this guys was acting like he was packed on the phone now he's taking down appointments for the day? Then I explain to him that I coil my hair from right to left and my sides I like faded. He literally fades my sides with 2 most obvious drops and doesn't even touch the top of my head. I explained to him that my hair was un even and if he could trim one side a bit more he acted like it was the first time he ever heard that. Then after 5 minutes of explaining his partner finally explained to him and he half assed it for 1/2 a minute then handed me the motor. Also through his phone call he asks me beard on or off, I said off. Too busy talking so he didn't even touch it. I figured the guy just wanted to send me on my way. My hair will grow back.. but my one star review will stay :) FYI his price is $25 I handed him $60 told him Merry Christmas and left. Never again."
11/30/16,0.406643357,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Great establishment ran by individuals with good moral values. Both barbers are attentive to details and really execute your requested hairstyle flawlessly. I've been coming to get my haircut by both of these barbers (Austin & Derrick) for awhile and I did not contemplate going anywhere else once they opened their own barbershop 15 miles  away from my house. They say you should always have one good barber, I am fortunate to have two. Another cool aspect about this shop is, every Wednesday they only take walk ins so there is no need to schedule an appointment. I definitely recommend this shop for anyone looking for a new barber."
9/27/17,0.391666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Friendly environment and barber's. Got a great cut on their walk-in Wednesday. Will be coming back!
5/12/17,0.285227273,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,"I've been getting cut but Derrick for years. I followed him from San mateo to his new shop. I would not let anyone touch my head besides him. Austin would be my back up for sure, he also has bars but Derrick is my guy. Definitely a friendly environment, they alway shave debates about sports or stuff that going on with our lives. Just make sure you get a appointment and your straight"
4/20/17,0.2875,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Punctual. Professional. Friendly. Affordable. Stylish. I can go on and on. I've been looking for a great barbershop for a long time and I found it. Can't wait to go back!
5/6/17,0.43,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've known Derrick for many years and it's great to see him and Austin open up their own shop. They're both skilled barbers and great people that really care about each person and build a sense of community. Even though my hair doesn't grow as fast these days, they always make me feel at home and my hairline look better. I highly recommend visiting them!"
4/20/17,0.158406544,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I was in a pinch and needed a haircut last minute. My regular barber was all booked. I went through my other barber contacts. ALL BOOKED. So I went Yelp. I been pretty much getting my haircut my entire adult life by two people so I was a little apprehensive just picking a guy on Yelp but, I was more than happy with the results. I called R&B around 9am. I told them I could be in the shop in the next 20 min. They told me to come on by. Clean, vibrant and very welcoming atmosphere right when I entered. Ken cut me up and it was rejuvenating. I felt like a new man. I even told him and I could tell he was a pro because how he cut and his attention to details with my haircut. I will def. keep Ken in mind the next time I need a cut."

1/19/17,0.2,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Excellent, professional service.  I called for an appointment and they were able to accommodate me the next day.  Derrick did a fantastic job on my sons hair.  He assessed the situation (bad haircut from mom) and being a visionary, he corrected the problem. You can't go wrong with two experienced barbers."

5/10/17,0.454365079,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I am glad Yelp's able to point us  at the right place to bring our son to have his haircut done. It turned out better than expected. I like how the place is easy to get to. Parking is easy. I am glad Derrick was able to squeeze us in today because they are always busy. So, call ahead and book your appointment if you don't want to miss out on a great haircut. Great job! Thank you again."
