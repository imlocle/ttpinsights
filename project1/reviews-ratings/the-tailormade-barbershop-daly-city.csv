10/5/17,0.036587302,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I set an appointment and they were really really flexible with the fact that I had school. My assigned barber, I believe it was Chad, was a bit behind on schedule and they were still able to get another one for me, in a very short amount of time! Tubbs was willing to get off his break to give me a cut. Which by the way, for what I requested, it took WAY less time than I thought. I didn't really know what I was doing seen as I don't go out to cut much and so I didn't really know what I wanted: but he got me a sharp hard part, an even fade, and a sick line up. All under 25 minutes and for $35! Definitely recommend. They're friendly, have a comfy couch and an aesthetic shop :)"

12/27/17,0.279166667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"My boy Pete does a great job cutting my hair! He takes his time to give you the the perfect cut you asked for. He used to work at fresh cut and he was the only one available working on a Sunday and he was kind enough to take me, and he's been my barber since. He's a very busy person so  you gotta make that appointment!"
2/2/18,0.1,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,My man Pete always hooks it up with the fresh cut. He always takes me in whenever he has a last minute cancel or opening. You can definitely count on Pete and Tailormade to deliver with dope service and fire style.

Tubby welcomes every customer with a greeting and never fails to provide assistance to anyone who walks in. Tubby has been cutting my hair close to 6 years now and each haircut is perfect! His passion towards every cut is shown through his work. With being a talented barber, tubby is also knowledgeable with hair products and grooming. Needless to say, i would recommend Tubby to anyone looking for a haircut without hesitation."

Both super talented and each time supplied great conversations along with a 5 star haircut. Everything you could ask for in a barber shop. The facility is homey as well. Got there a bit early one time and they have a comfy couch and usually some sports playing on the TVs. Good, clean atmosphere. Keep up the good work!"
12/15/17,0.2,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This is a spacious and professional barbershop where I've never walked out disappointed. I've been getting cut by the barber Tubbs for quite some time now.Tubbs is super responsive with setting up appointments, which is helpful when trying to plan out the rest of your week. Tubbs will help you figure out a hairstyle you'll be happy with, and not take the easy way out. He's suggested haircuts for me that are more time consuming than my usual buzz cut, which showed me that he's not trying to rush me out out of the shop. All in all, I truly feel respected as a customer/client here and I would recommend anyone to check this spot out. Easily, 5 stars."

11/11/17,0.180647383,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,We were looking for a babrbershop for my son in the area that was able to do haircuts that arent basic or old fashioned. We saw tailor made and decided to give it a try after looking at photos of customers on google etc. My son got a comb over with a line up and I must say Jay was amazing. My son now will go nowhere else but here to have his haircut. Hes been here three times in the past year to different barbers and just recently had chad cut his hair and we never have been disapointed. We now live in San Jose and make the drive up here just because our son trusts them with his hair! The Lines are clean and they know exactly what they are doing. Thanks guys!

One and a half years later I come back once a month and Chad has been my barber ever since. He pays attention to detail, is quick to respond when you try to book an appointment, and it's always fun to watch a game and chat with Mark and Sherm when you're there.

3/31/17,-0.01461039,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"So disappointed. I was there recently. I paid 30 bucks for the haircut and 5 bucks for tips. The haircut was just usual one, nothing special at all. After I got home I didn't like the way they made me sideburns, so in a couple of days I called them and asked to change it a little bit. It would take max 5 min in total. It's really little upgrade, but they told me that I have to make a new appointment and pay for the haircut again. No service honestly!"

The atmosphere of Tailormade was mellow, clean, and welcoming. Tubz did a proper consultation and delivered what I wanted even despite some challenges he crossed when cutting my hair. I would recommend this barber shop. I will be returning to Tubz, so I can stay tailormade."
1/9/16,0.358854167,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I'm very glad I found The Tailormade Barbershop through Yelp.  After reading the reviews on here and being pressed that I have to leave for overseas in a couple of days, it was great these guys could accommodate an appointment for me within three hours of my call.  Since I am particular about the kind of cut I like and want (the other reviews on here also helped in my choosing The Tailormade guys), I was scheduled with Mark who did a superb job!  He's really laidback, friendly and a top professional.  I brought a sample photo of what I wanted and that's what I got.  The shop is nicely laid-out with a comfy brown couch for waiting, three flat screen TV's perched on the walls, and magazines to keep your attention.  Making an appointment ahead of time is a definite must to be seen here since these guys get busy.  It's definitely a great place I will return to the next time I am in town and in need of a hair-cut!"

My guy Luis aka Tubz aka Tubby always hooks it up with the freshest fades in the bay area. The guy can to do any and every type of haircut . He takes his time with your cut, rarely does he rush through his cutz. The pricing here is reasonable it's not too expense. You have three widescreen T.V.'s in the shop, and a comfortable waiting area . Only downside might be the parking. Overall this place is great with a phenomenal staff ; who knows how to cut hair. Highly recommend this place!"

I've been taking my two boys here since they were able to sit calmly by themselves in the barberchair, and let me tell you...little boys move a LOT and squirm a whole lot haha! Thank GOD the barber I bring my boys to, Sherman, is so patient and skillful. I've seen his cuts from clients before my appointments, and they always leave looking fresh and cleanly lined up. Can't ask for more! 1) Easy parking. Close proximity to freeways, shopping centers, food spots2) Modern, clean, trendy furnishings...can't wait to see the finished shop when it's completely done with it's move-in3) TV and music while you wait4) Never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my appointment5) Great vibe, attitude, and energy from all the barbers6) and last but definitely not least...GREAT CUTS, GREAT PRICES, GREAT LOCATION, GREAT BARBER!!!!!!!!!"

Thank you Chad!   I'll be back next month."
10/21/16,0.138333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Been going to Mark and the shop in general for about 4 years now since 2012. I got my first cut for my freshman year of high school, when the shop was back on Mission. I could personally say that these barbers won't disappoint. I am now a freshman in college and every appointment gets better time after time. Mark has been my go to barber and hopefully yours too if you been searching for one. He takes extra time on my head especially because my hair is hella thick, but that still doesn't get in the way of what he is capable of doing. I would forsure recommend him for anyone looking for a professional yet chill and talented barber."
3/27/16,0.320357143,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"First time I've been to this place, got a cut from tubs and its one of the best haircuts I've gotten in my life. He made sure every detail was on point and made sure that I got what I asked for. What I also liked about this place was that not only your barber interacts with you but other barbers also made sure you were taken care of. The barbershops setup was very modern. Three tvs, that way you could watch while you get a haircut. Has a lot of room for the people who are waiting. Different magazines to pass time while you wait. Overall this place is a definite go to if you're looking for a fresh cut and good customer service."

His attention to detail and ability to ""get it right"" is what keeps me coming back.The shop itself is pretty nice. Comfy couch area while you're waiting. There are threes tvs always on so you're entertained, and not to mention stacks of mags.Pro tip: Be sure to book a week in advance. Walk-ins are welcomed but ill-advised. They're good, people know it. Don't settle for a mediocre haircut because you can't wait a week."

6/21/14,0.207471264,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"First impression is all you have. Never coming back. With so many talented Barbers around - you can find a place that is friendly towards kids. Lesson learned.Come to think of it...was my godson and I recently discriminated against? Or what just happened. 1210p, I walked in and ask what was the wait time. Guy initially said 30-40 minutes. I said I'll be back - as I had to get cash. He said $22 per person / kid and adult. Ok, no problem. I left and returned 15 minutes later @1230p. When we walked in - the guy - barber have me a blank stare, a ""what are you doing here"" kinda look. No real welcome at all. Kinda snobby place. He then said, ""we are booked until 4p"". I said, ""are you by appts only"" , he said ""no"". I realized that I wasn't happy with the entire interaction and immediately made the Bline for the door. The barber said ""want a business card?"" --- ummmm, seriously? No. And I left. Man these young bucks need to learn a thing or two about customer expiernece. No amount of blade skills will replace a genuine good person. Daly City is not the town for act all snobby. Meh whatever. Now I'm at 1620 Barber in SSF, pretty happy here. Chicago Barbershop II is pretty chill and friendly too. Last thought, what's up with the blacked out windows? Y'all not that cool. Seriously."

I'm very picky when it comes to my hair, and was impressed with Mark's work. If you're in need of good barbershop these guys are all good. I was observing everyone while I was waiting. Only downside is, is that you have to make an appointment so just make sure you call ahead."
10/1/14,0.192857143,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been going to tailormade for a little while, since moving out here two years back. Before that they were called ""Barbershop"" and a cut cost $20, I think?  I've seen both Mark and Ben. If you ate looking for an extremely tight fade or tape up, Mark is great. If you want a little scissor action on top, Ben is great. All guys here are talented barbers.My only complaint is the price increase and how far they've moved from their original location. Coming from the east coast a cut was never more than $17. That being said, this is the bay area and nothing is cheap so $25 for a cut is reasonable. As far as the location now being 2 more miles out up.hill, well I guess my fat ass can use the workout lol.Quality cuts, end of story"

Needless to say was extremely disappointed and upset. On my way home I saw the shop tailormade and  I decided to stop to see if they could do anything to fix my haircut. After walking in I really enjoyed the atmosphere going on inside the shop. I asked the first Barber I saw if he had any openings and explain to him my situation, he was very professional and asked me to just have me seat in his chair and he took care of me as soon as he could. After dealing with him and having him fix what the last guy messed up I was for sold and I officially had a new barber. I couldn't be happier with the end result and I can't wait to get lined back up again. I highly recommend this shop and Tubbs cutting your hair."

There has always been parking right in front of the barbershop, just 25 cents for over 15 minute parking."
