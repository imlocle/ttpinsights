2/14/18,0.252886905,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I was looking for a barbershop that had more than just fades and high and tight haircuts. I wanted a decent scissor cut, nothing fancy. I found Berkeley Barbers on Yelp and decided to try Valerie based on the reviews. She was friendly and listened to what I wanted. I ended up with a perfect haircut. I'll definitely be back as a regular customer."

10/20/17,-0.113492063,Negative,1,2.0 star rating,2,"I know there are multiple barbers at Berkeley, but the guy that cut my hair should definitely change professions. He got offended when I tried to tell him how I wanted my hair cut and when I could tell he was going in the wrong direction, he was confrontational when I asked if he knew how I wanted it to look. He absolutely butchered it, Worst haircut I've ever had hands down! I would NEVER go here again and would avoid any place that has people like this working there. Good thing about haircuts though, 3 or 4 weeks and its like it never happened."
11/1/17,0.124415584,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"Valerie cut my hair. I knew I came to the right place as soon as I sat in the chair because she was very detail oriented, and asked me every step of the way when she was unsure with how I wanted something. As a result, my haircut came out just the way I wanted it to. I've always had trust issues with new barbers, but I think I found my regular.  Definitely would recommend this place."
2/8/17,0.323796296,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Great place. I've become increasingly bald so I usually just shave my head but decided to give having hair a shot again. Got a haircut and beard trim from Cat and she actually helped me feel good about having hair again... Nice work! Definitely recommend this place. Classic barbershop feel, very friendly with very reasonable prices."
3/22/17,0.321590909,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Love Valerie! I've seen her twice now, and she has done a great job both times. She is very friendly and fast. I am very particular about my hair because I have a strong cowlick, and she has cut my hair in a way that makes it lay flat. It is also only $25, which is great for WLA. I will definitely be going back!"
12/27/16,0.073333333,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"I stopped by randomly a while ago, because I needed to shape up my sidecut. When I walked in, I was attended to by an older, unfriendly gentleman. Now, the total time of service was probably 2 minutes. I was charged $25. I've never paid more than $11 to trim a sidecut. Maybe it's because I'm a woman. Maybe it's because they needed to meet a quota that day. Absolute robbery."

12/13/16,0.426041667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,My boyfriend was in need of quick haircut.  No where could accommodate until we called Berkeley Barbers and Val said it would be a short wait.  We showed up and didn't have to wait at all.  She gave him a fast cut - great fade.

8/2/16,0.40125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Val Bentancor provided me with a quick and perfect cut! She accommodated me with little notice and did an excellent job with lining me up. Val is also very funny and laid back - which helps make a trip to the barber even better! I love the quick shoulder massage the haircut experience comes with after she shampoos your hair! I'll definitely be back because of Val!
8/31/16,0.08495671,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,5 stars because of Val Bentancor!  I was a little hesitant since my regular LA hair stylist was not available so thanks to Yelp! - I found Berkeley Barbers and Val! She cut my hair really fast and it was on-point.  Haircut was $25 and it came with shampooing and quick shoulder massage service.  Val made me feel comfy being with a new stylist.

Every time I walk in with a huge head of hair because I'm lazy to get a consistent cut, but Tracy always gives me a consistent cut and great conversation to make the time pass by fast.Free parking in the back, can't ask for more than that in West LA."
10/1/15,0.190925926,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,"I have been a fan for about 5 years now and have been with both Leslie and now currently Keith as my barbers and I have to give them my highest recommendation. As Leslie is no longer available at Berkeley Barbers this review will mainly pertain to Kieth. First of all a standard haircut is only $23 dollars which is completely worth it if you consider the quality of the cut, personal conversation, shampoo washing, straight razor to the neck and sometimes if time even a massage! This place is a dream and Kieth is always friendly and entertaining. He is so down to earth and easy to schedule an appointment with. I don't know if I can ever go anywhere else.Every once in awhile though, I think I will track down Leslie who operates now in the valley somewhere. :)"

2/11/15,0.049702381,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"This review is strictly for Valerie as I have not tried the other barbers there , but I probably wont try after my experience with valerie.I went in with no appointment and valerie was the only one available. So I read a few reviews on here about how good she was and was sort of excited.So let me to you about my experience. The haircut lasted 5 mins. I always ask for a faux hawk with a one on the side. So valerie gave me a one on the side super fast. Then she use scissors to cut the top. The top was so choppy it was horrible. I mean if you are going be fast on a haircut I have no problem with, but at least look at the hair after you cut it."
10/14/13,0.295726496,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Yep.  This is my barber.  I had been looking around for one in the area.  I tried the Floyd's, I tried the Tel's, I tried just about every shop with a generic barber-sounding guy's name attached to it and finally I was like ""Ugh...Berkeley.""But I've had two great cuts here and I keep coming back.  I tried Leslie, like a lot of people suggested, then accidentally tried Mike.  Honestly, Mike was much better for my hair (I'm a dude, short inconceivably straight hair) and gave me a cut that looked good even 2 months down the road.  I recommend him, but you have to get his number specifically because he's too cool for the rest of the shop.The place itself is nice, low-key, nothing fancy.  Exactly what I was looking for from a barbershop."
9/1/16,0.59047619,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Val is great! She gave my boyfriend an awesome haircut! Very quick cut and perfect fade! She was able to accommodate a last minute request since we were in a rush! Highly recommended!
4/4/15,0.486363636,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Berkeley  Barbers is the best kept secret in LA. Top notch hair cuts, for an affordable price, and a fabulous and fun environment to hang out in. I have been coming to B&B for years, and from the first visit, never looked back. Great stylists like Valerie represent the best LA has to offer. You'll be completely satisfied with the expedient service she provides, offering great quality in no time at all!5 stars? I rate you at 6 six stars!"
7/4/15,0.193452381,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Been coming here off and (mostly) on since 1991 and I've never once had a bad experience. For the past five years I've had the pleasure to have Keith cut my hair and he gets it right every time. I walk in feeling like Chewbacca wearing a mohair sweater and I come out feeling like a Scot who's jumped out of a plane wearing a kilt and no underwear (I'm guessing that's a good feeling.)Anyway, love it here, and Keith is always personable and skillful. Go already!"
1/26/16,0.671428571,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Depends who you get here. Some are better than others. But overall a good choice at a good price. Men's haircuts are awesome. Don't try to get a blowout here. You won't be happy. And the shoeshine is convenient and awesome.
1/18/16,0.121527778,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"Berkeley Barbers is great. Quick, easygoing, and quality haircuts. I was relocated to LA from NYC for six months, and was desperate for my old NY haircut place after striking out at the first and second LA barbershops I tried. Then I found Berkeley and I was much happier. Saw lots of other guys in the shop that looked like repeat customers, and I can see why. I'm back in NY now but would go back to Berkeley next time I need a haircut in the LA/Santa Monica area."
4/18/15,0.329761905,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Valerie is fantastic.  She has a great personality and knows what she is doing.  She works quickly but carefully.  She gives you ideas along the way, but delivers exactly what you, the customer, want.  Plus she is hilarious!  I look forward to seeing her every three weeks and can't recommend her highly enough."
9/22/15,0.506818182,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I found this place by accident one day and am so glad I did! Valerie is the absolute best! She now cuts my sons and husband's hair. My youngest son used to scream when he got his hair cut but she has such a calm way about her that he is happy to go and get his hair cut. She does an incredible job and is so nice to chat with! She has a son the same age as one of my boys and has given me such great advice. I adore her!
5/1/15,0.433333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"$23 for a haircut...I had a great experience..I kinda dont want to give out the name of the barber cause I want it easy for me to get an appointment with her, but anyways it was Valarie. WIll start going here regularly for sure."
5/1/15,0.298484848,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Decided to try a new barber today and booked an appointment with Val. She is amazing! Gave me the exact look I wanted (pompadour). Val cuts hair fast but she always makes sure you are getting exactly what you want. Highly recommend her! Free parking in the back and street parking in the front!.
9/1/15,0.327651515,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Great spot!  Since I just relocated to Santa Monica and in dire need of a barber, I was a little scared finding a new place.  However, Tracy was totally spot on and gave me an awesome haircut, just like how my regular barber gave my cut back in NY.  Very happy I found this place and I would definitely go back."
8/21/14,0.325262626,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Moved to Westwood this week - after reading positive reviews on Yelp, I decided I'd visit due to proximity.  It lived up to expectations.Really cool space; I didn't realize, but reportedly has free parking around back; nice barbers; most importantly, I got a great cut and shampoo at a very reasonable price.  Cut was $21, shampoo was $2.I had Nick (I think), an affable older guy with an accent.  He made suggestions, but actually listened to what I wanted - a skill that many barbers lack.  And then he executed.Thumbs up all around.  I'll be back."
6/14/16,0.191666667,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"Called one night prior to get an appointment. Was given a vague, tentative commitment to an ""walk in time"" (whatever that is), and then showed up the next day to discover that I'd have to wait over an hour - not an awesome first experience. In an age of voice recognition technology and soon-to-be self-driving cars, I'm a bit perplexed by a pen-and-paper appointment book and a resultant double-booking. Will give them another shot, however, and update this posting."
8/20/15,0.286428571,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"My favorite haircut place of all time. I am extremely picky about my haircuts and Frank gets it right EVERY SINGLE TIME. All the other barbers are friendly and awesome. Overall an absolutely fantastic place to get a haircut. Whats more the prices are under $25 for men. I don't even want to tell you what I was spending on haircuts before....ask for Frank, he's the man!"
2/5/13,0.416666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"my husband likes this place, so we go there every month or 2. Valerie is the one that my husband relies on. She is really nice and does the work quickly. What I like about this place is that it feels like an old barber's from some 1960s, and they have many interesting items on walls and around to browse.BTW the massage after the cut is nice too. Thanks Val. See you =)"
12/29/12,0.128388889,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I am a woman with very short hair and I've had my hair cut here five or six times. To date I have never had less than a stellar experience! The barbers are all very professional and the price can't be beat ($21 for a cut and shampoo). I was surprised to see someone's less-than-polite review of Valerie. I always have a great time when she does my hair - she is so sweet and she does a great job, and she's tons of fun to chat with! If you ask for her you won't be disappointed. As with all the other barbers she's professional and has years of experience.Free parking is available behind the building (turn on Harvard). Cash or check only, and there's an ATM inside."
3/7/13,0.132716049,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I followed Leslie here from Don's, just FYI that I have a more detailed review on their page.  Leslie is a great stylist and she knows what kind of cut I like. Been her customer for over a year and have been to numerous different stylists.  I admit it, I've even cheated on her when I wasn't in the area and needed a cut.  MY BAD!  The other cuts were not as good and the cutting process was horrible (think hair pulling and a girl that put too much pressure on scalp while combing).  I will be loyal to good ole' Leslie as long as I have hair... which might have an end date that's near (thanks to my genes!).Berkeley overall has an old school feel to it, but plenty of entertainment around.  TV's, magazine, heck even toys for the kids to pass the time.  I dig the decor and reminds me of being in an mix between an old mechanic's shop and a diner.  They have a shoe shiner and a lady who does nails, if you need some extra pampering.  They also have FREE PARKING in the back. Key aspect in this part of LA. Overall just a good ole' fashioned 1950's feel where customer service is king.  I'm a fan and enjoy getting my haircuts here."
11/28/13,0.245538721,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,"It's always a bit of a hassle finding a new barber, but after seeing some reviews of this place, I decided to take a look for myself and find out. When you first walk in, you can tell this place looks and feels like a traditional barber. You see people reading the newspaper and everyone looks like they are your neighbor and you are greeted appropriately. My hair is generally pretty easy to cut, just buzz off most of it and finish with the scissors. I have a nice chat with my barber and the time just flies by, which is something that I love about this place. They finish you off with a straight razor, a nice hot lather, and cool aftershave. This is really what the barber shop experience is all about.I always ask for a wash, because I hate having hair fall everywhere as I go about my day. All of this for only 21 dollars?It seems pretty reasonable to me."
7/3/14,0.377083333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I go see Val about every 3 weeks on my lunch break- she's great! Fast, precise and lots of fun! My roommate and I have been going here for about a year now; recently even got a straight-razor shave.It's a very classic barber shop with a lot of vintage decor. Highly recommend!"

One client in there and older barbers they gave me Nick , I was at first skeptical because he's an older gentlemen but good ol nick fixed my hair. Made me look great and it was cheaper then crappy Rudy's"

10/21/12,0.205035651,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Two words: Call LESLIE.I moved to LA in 2009 and needed to look for someone to cut my hair. After a few months of botched haircuts and barbers just looking to get me in and out of the chair... I met Leslie and haven't ""cheated"" on her since. Not only does she actually LISTEN to what you're looking for, she makes sure that you leave her chair completely happy with the way you look. You'll never need anyone else to cut your hair.She's funny, intelligent and genuinely friendly, which only adds to the experience in the most positive light. Anyone that doesn't like this chick should probably just go back to hell where he or she came from.Stop going to those generic hair salons where you're stuck with a different barber every time you stop in. If you're not calling LESLIE for your next hair cut then you're just settling for less......a LOT less."

I went in wanting something and she gave me a new look, all the ladies love me now. Besides the fact that COPS own this place, I still return. Even though COPS own this place, all cash business?? Either way, the staff is the best, the place rocks and if COPS own it, then that is cool with me, just keepin it old school at Berkeley Barbers, seriously go see Val, she rocks!!!To all the barbers of the world, we love you and all you do to make our dew true!!

5/9/13,0.299222222,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"GO TO LESLIE!I started seeing Leslie when I moved to Los Angeles 4 years ago...at another shop in SM. She eventually moved over to Berkeley Barbers, and I moved with her just like most of her clients did! I've gone to fancy salons and all that, but nothing compares to her skill-set. She's very cool, does whatever she can to work around your schedule, and is downright awesome at cutting hair.The shop itself is pretty appealing. It has the typical barber shop feel, you can even get your shoes shined and get a manicure/pedicure all DURING your cut. It's truly a one stop shop.Even though I love the barbershop, it's safe to say that I'll be following Leslie wherever she goes. However, doesnt look like shes going anywhere because she seems pretty happy here. Leslie can do it all, you'll make a BIG mistake by passing up on her! When I visit home (Bay Area), I don't let anyone else touch my hair...I wait till im back in LA. I originally found her on Yelp, and hope that this review helps you find her as well."
11/14/14,0.163236961,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Walked right in with no appointment. Tom was available so I sat down gave him little to no direction on how I wanted it cut. Ended up coming out great I'll definitely be going back. $23 for the cut.
12/22/11,0.16875,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"As others have pointed out, this barber shop has a very nostalgic feel with the decor. While the outside is modern, the inside takes you back to a time... Well... Before I was a gleam in my pappy's eye. ;)So what about the hair cut? I've been getting my hair cut by Leslie for a couple years now, and she is great! She is very personable and does a great job cutting my hair each time I go in to see her. Her hair cuts are very consistent, so I'm never worried about having it come out differently each time (my gripe about Supercuts, Fantastic Sams, etc.).Highly recommended!"

Darrin hooked me up with a sweet haircut that looks great with minimal to no effort on my part.

7/26/12,0.172293388,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This place is awesome! I had been buzzing my hair for the last two years and decided that I wanted to change things up. I proceeded to let my hair start growing and after about a month figured it would be worth it to splurge on my first real haircut in years. To make a long story short, I wasted my money (MUCH more than I've ever spent on a haircut) at a high end place on Montana. Having realized that I just threw away money for a haircut that was worse than most I had gotten in my life I looked to my trusty friend Yelp to help remedy the situation. I found Berkeley Barbers and saw that Leslie was praised highly and proceeded to make an appointment with her. From the minute I sat in the chair I felt at ease with Leslie and it was obvious that she knew what she was doing. She's good at having a real conversation and making you feel comfortable. I told her what I was looking for and thirty or so minutes later I was walking out with the best haircut I've had in years.  If you're looking for somewhere new to get your haircut, do not hesitate to call Leslie! You will not be disappointed!!!"
1/24/12,0.26037037,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"My husband and I have both been going to Leslie for hair cuts for about 6 months now, and we both LOVE her. The fact that she can make us both happy speaks volumes to her talent (we both have very thick, difficult hair... and we're picky). Leslie's cuts are consistent, she's super sweet, AND she'll give you the best deal in Santa Monica. She even lets us bring our dog when we come in! It's basically perfection in a haircut. Go see her and tell her Beans the French Bulldog sent ya."
9/6/14,-0.078333333,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,Frank is the Man! I get compliments weeks after the hair cut. Why go anywhere else? If there is a wait...well worth it. I call a few days ahead of time just so I don't miss out. But now a few years later it's hard for them to keep a appointment. I moved on.
10/10/11,0.250411523,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Let me first start by saying I am extremely particular about who cuts my hair. I have had 4 barbers cut my hair on a regular basis in my 29 years of life. So I wouldn't vouch for any ol' place. When I moved to SoCal I looked and tried several places. I came to Berkeley Barbers by chance and some how ended up having a cut by Frank. Done deal! Been coming back to get cuts by Frank over a year now.The shop is a cool place with the vintage barber memorabilia. There are several barbers that all seem to give old school cuts and have regulars come in and stay loyal to their barber. Very welcoming place and everyone is really chill.As for the cut from Frank, he always seems to understand where you're going with your description of the cut you want and need. Hot shaving cream to clean your hair line or face shave. Quick cuts, but NEVER rushed. From classic cuts to buzz cuts and fades, Frank got you covered. Frank is a cool guy and is always down to chat and talk some shit about sports or whatever is on your mind and if you go on a regular basis he'll remember your name, cut and the last conversation you had. What else could you ask for? A great cut at a reasonable price, sports on two flat-screens, good conversation and the shoulder massage after the cut is the best. That's some real old school barber stuff there. Walk-ins are welcomed, but Frank tends to have a lot of people coming through, so feel free to call and ask for Frank. He'll set up an appt. and you won't look any longer for a great cut."
9/4/13,0.071590909,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,This review is for Mike Lopez. I've been following him around now for a few years and even though I live on the eastside I still make it over every 2-3 weeks for a cut. He's a perfectionist and a true pro with the scissors. He rents out a spot here and doesn't take walkins so give him a call 310-866-8571
11/28/12,0.279090909,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"It was these very reviews that brought me to Berkeley Barbers and Leslie, so it's only fair to pair it forward. In a city where pricey haircuts seem so justifiable it is really cool to get a good one for $20.  Leslie is, to quote another review, boss.  It's never too difficult to get in on short notice and she's very reachable by text.  She also knows how to blend your vision of hairstyle with what objectively looks best on your dome. The place has a great old school vibe that you see new places trying to emulate all the time.  Actual retro with prices that feel more like the 80's."
8/26/12,0.310645604,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"This about hair cuts for men, I am S's husband. This place is pretty good. Low cost (~$21+$5 tip), quick, consistent. I dont like places that just ask what number to do and then shave your head (ie Floyd's about a mile east). It is pretty simple to cut my hair. Shorter on the sides, give the top some shape, no big deal. I have been to two different people there, on 4 different occasions and it always looks pretty good. The best haircut I have every had was done by a lady in westwood, Riely. It was super awesome but took 40 min and cost $50. That works for very special occasion but for normal maintenance you need to go a little cheaper. This place is local to me and I will be returning. I would recommend it to guys for sure. I would give it a 5 if I had the same super awesome hair cut I paid $50 for constantly, but they get pretty close and those expectations may be unreasonable."

I moved to Los Angeles about on year ago and it took me forever to find a barber shop that could do a quick efficient mens haircut for a reasonable price. After stumbling into berkeley barbers I got a haircut by Valerie and knew I didn't have to look anymore! She is the best and coolest hairdresser I have ever had and if you don't go to her your missing out! 5 stars all all the way because of her! Go, and wait for Valerie, you won't be dissapointed."

A few years ago I read that if you want a good-looking haircut for a man, then go to place that specializes in cutting men's hair. And when you find someone who gives you the haircut you want every time without fail, you stick with them. Not long after that, I discovered Berkeley Barbers, and it's the ONLY place I go for a haircut. I found my barber.I've gotten great haircuts from Bill (who has since passed away), Keith, Mike, and one other whose name I don't recall. I've never been unhappy with a haircut from any of them.However, a year and a half ago I came in without an appointment and waited for a few minutes. By chance, Valerie's chair opened first. ""Lucky you"", said the guy who was after me. How right he turned out to be. I haven't gotten a haircut from anybody but her since then, and that's not going to change. When I want something specific, I get exactly what I want. When I want to change things up a little bit, she offers suggestions and I get a great haircut.And to top it off, she's cute and entertaining to talk to.Trust me: you want to get your haircut here, and you want it done by the curly-haired blond. Ask for Val."

They spend 20-30 mins total doing a thorough job.I didn't like the cuts by some others. After shaving the back of the neck one barber used rough paper towel to wipe off the cream. Frank would never do that. He uses a cloth towel. When I politely complained about it, she brushed it off like I was making too much out of it. From then on I started getting appointments with Frank instead of walking in and getting the first available barber. You will notice that some customers will wait for the good barbers like Frank even when other barbers are free.Saturday is very busy. Appointments fill up fast for the good barbers. Sunday is not busy, but there are only a few barbers. Frank works on Sunday too."

3/14/12,0.086269841,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"I went here following Leslie after she moved from Don's Cutting Edge.First the haircut: Same GREAT haircut by Leslie. She really knows her stuff and it always grows out great. I got to know her better this time (this is the second time she's cut my hair). She is a great gal and always fun to talk to.Now the environment: It has decorations of an old barber shop right down to the old fashioned chairs. A lot, and I mean a lot of decorations old fashioned decorations. On the scale of decorated to cluttered I'd say it's definitely leaning towards the cluttered side, but it definitely gets the feel across. Not to mention a lot of the old items area really cool to look at. They have a nice wet shaving collection, which I was particularly drawn to, as I am a wetshaver myself. The feel much different from Don's, which exudes the old time barber shop in its simplicity and laid back style, where here it's thrown at you and maybe a little forced. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does change the feel of the environment.Why Four-Stars: The reason why is not because of the decorations, but because of the environment that was created by allowing solicitors in. Within the hour that I was there, there were two different people who came in asking for money. One was a girl who was asking for donations (not a customer), and the other was a high energy broom, parisol, etc. saleswoman. The first was less overt, and could have easily slipped by anyone who was watching for solicitors. The former was putting on her sales presentation down the main aisle and it was quite obvious she was selling her wares. I don't know if this is common practice here, but I didn't take to it and considered dropping my rating to three stars.I left my rating at four stars because overall it was an enjoyable experience and the solicitors didn't ruin my experience. I recommend this place, and hope management will make strides to reduce the number of solicitors."

For the longest time, my hair was a catastrophe of biblical proportions. I used to just get my hair buzzed short (which always looked horrible) then let it grow out into a long, thick, wavy disheveled mop (which also looked horrible). I have been to several barbers, both in the area and elsewhere around Los Angeles. In the past, I would usually meet a barber and tell them to do what they think works. Like I said, usually ended up buzzed and I was dissatisfied.My life, with respect to my hairstyle, changed the day I met Leslie. At the time, I had strolled into her prior place of business looking for a cut. She asked what I was looking to do, and I asked her to make it look good, something professional, but still fun such that I don't look boring in front of my friends. She gave me a great cut! Better than all those before and with practically no instruction. I have been to her every month since for the past 6 months with consistently amazing cuts. I couldn't be happier."

This is my first actual yelp review after years of using yelp almost daily, so that hopefully tells you how bad this was. I think the barber who cut my hair was new, he was behind the desk and was the one who answered the phone when I called to ask for availability. I should have gone with my instinct and avoided this place when I called in and the guy who answered asked me what day/date it was and then couldn't remember right after I told him. But I came in and it turned out, this was the guy cutting my hair. I seriously think he was high or something. He seemed out of it and his hands were not steady. In the end he completely messed up my hair. Going to go to another shop to hopefully see if they can salvage some semblance of a good cut out of this, but it may be too late with some of the reckless snips this guy made."

(face shave for extra charge of course)  Its Frank.   He is a good guy, and a great barber.   He works Wednesday - Sunday.  Call and ask for him.  BTW, Kim, who does nails is great.  My wife likes going to her because the shop DOES NOT smell like nail polish remover.  Larry will shine your shoes as well."

Also, I'm pretty sure I got charged $24, and I did not get any fancy neck massage like everyone else seems to have gotten.

I work a couple blocks away and the total time of my entire trip with hair cut was 20 mins. Valerie was super nice, and gave me exactly what I wanted. I wouldn't recommend asking for anything fancy though. The neck shave and massage was so relaxing that i didn't want to go back to work. the only reason i didn't give the full five was the price but at $20 its not terrible."

I have very difficult hair for a guy: part curly, part wavy, part cowlicks and she tamed them all. Great cut and great conversation, not to mention the straight razor neck shave and the shoulder massage at the end. Leslie works hard to make you satisfied and you certainly will be after your expert cut here."

I highly recommend Frank  - great personality, great haircut every time! I recommend him to people all the time."

Love Berkeley barbers- very cool looking place, and friendly staff. Leslie is the best- I'm out of town 9 months out of the year and I refuse to get haircuts from anyone but her. Definitely worth looking into!"
3/11/08,0.343258929,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"This is a really good barber-actually four or five barbers. I have always gotten a decent haircut and it is not that pretentious.  It is very comfortable. It doesn't smell funny and the floor is clean. There is never a line and the conversations that are made are between client and customer and not that intrusive. I have even bet on a horse. YEAH I WON!!! twenty dollars the price of a cut. They have some cool antique barber stuff  on the walls too. However, I am neutral on the neck massage."
