I love his honesty, steady hand and ability to interpret what I wanted to accomplish when I came in at the end of a very hectic day.He made some great suggestions and gave me an excellent cut. Not to mention the price was amazing.Thank you and cannot wait to color my hair Sat!XOJK"
3/18/18,-0.107291667,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"you would be hard pressed to find a worse barber shop in the area... and most of the barber shops here just don't cut it. i actually hate myself for even going here.if you like unprofessional receptionists, late barbers for appointments, and HAVE NEVER NEEDED TO TRIM YOUR BEARD IN YOUR LIFE, you'll love this place. BECAUSE CLEARLY, NOT ONE OF THE ""BARBERS"" IN THERE HAS EVER TRIMMED A BEARD. this place is for the fantastic sam's and supercut rejects, who cut hair because they need a check. they should close up so as not to lure any other optimistic neighbors to your pathetic excuse for a barber shop.  the rent's got to be expensive, right?*disclaimer - i just got home from being butchered there. came in with a beard the vikings would be proud of, and left looking like i trimmed my beard eyes-closed with a blindfold and my hands tied.just re-read this and i decided i dont care if i look bitter. this place legitimately sucks."
3/9/18,0,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,They are liar they told me on the phone price for the hair cut but when I finished the overcharged me and the lady she can't used the razor and they charged me as they did my beard the price was on the phone $25 for haircut and $10 for beard but I paid $47 at the end

I have a thick hair, but she always manages to make it look nice. She also provides some advice on how to style it and is super friendly! If you are looking for a trustworthy stylist, I highly recommend Nandu."
1/5/18,0.334063853,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Nandu has been cutting my hair for over 5 years and is the only person I trust to give me a haircut. Nandu knows how to perfectly style my hair and does an excellent job. Even though I don't live in LA anymore, I always wait to get my hair cut when I come to visit my parents. She's also super friendly!"
12/30/17,0.216666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I needed a haircut and I saw this place so I walked in on a whim. It wasn't busy and William was available. I've been going to the same barber for a few years so I don't know what to expect here. In the end William gave me the best fade i've ever had and I will be coming back here to see him from now on.
3/23/18,-0.325,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,Do not get your haircut from William! He didn't follow my simple instructions and I ended up with the worst haircut of my life. I didn't even bother having him try to fix it because I had zero confidence in him after seeing the mess he created. There are plenty of other barbershops in the area -- choose one of those instead.
1/26/18,0.714285714,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Just wanted to say Nandu is an awesome hair stylist.  She listens to what I want and does a great job.  Always has some tips to make my haircut look nice and neat and stylish.  I'm glad I found her and would recommend her if you are looking for a great hair stylist.  She has always done great by me.
1/28/18,0.216666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Ask for Nandu. I have been following her wherever she goes! She can cut long hair for men or do great fades. She also has a great personality and we always get into interesting conversation. Give her a try and you won't be disappointed.
1/15/18,-0.033503401,Negative,1,2.0 star rating,2,"Don't go here :(I went here for what has to be one of the easiest haircuts ever, other than a straight buzz. I asked for a fade with about an inch left on the top. When the guy was ""done,"" it was totally uneven. I had to point out spots where it was clearly longer than others, sticking out all over. When he touched these spots up I can't say he was exuding confidence.Upon further inspection when I got home, the left side of my head is way tighter than the right. The right looks like there's a chunk missing. I am early anticipating a few weeks from now when I can go to an actual barber and get this fixed. Semi-related: the equipment was not professional at all. He used the same clippers you or I could find next to the gloves at TJ Maxx. Not at all comparable to other barber shops in LA. Sad!"
9/26/17,0.502222222,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,The best barber in town hands down goes to Rita she's perfect. Fresh and clean always
6/13/17,-0.069871795,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"Do not go here if you are looking for a proper barber or a fade. I just had an experience where the barbers clippers weren't working. It was pulling my hair so she put oil on it but it kept on pulling my hair. It was very uncomfortable. She then tried to fade it by hand. She told me how most barbers that go to school can't fade by hand and that she is a ""real"" barber.Then she proceeds to ask me how many barber shops I've been too which was an insult to say the least. Regardless I asked her to not touch anything else on my head. Probably the worst attempt at a fade I've ever had. It's lopsided and completely uneven. Save your time and money and go to a proper barber shop.I don't want to say anything about the other barbers there. My experience was with An older, taller, blonde haired female."
11/24/17,0,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,Showed very specific pictures of what I wanted and instead cut into parts I'd been purposely trying to grow out.
10/18/17,0.027777778,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,Nope. Move along. Most sloppy haircut I've ever had. Won't be coming back.

8/5/17,0.4775,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"In the past, I have gone to one of those ""chain"" walk-in haircut shops.  But they always kept me waiting and did a below average job.Now that I have found Christie at Eddie's Barbershop, I have a place I love to cut my hair!  I never thought as a woman I would go to a place called a ""barbershop"" but I am SO glad I did.They are kind, courteous, professional and gave me the best haircut I've had in years.You must try this awesome place whether you are a gal or a guy...walk-in or make an appointment.  You won't be sorry!I am thrilled with the results!"
7/21/17,0.009166667,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"Please consider this a ZERO star. Worst barber I have ever experienced. Definitely will never go there again.Not a friendly place. Considering hygiene, I do not recommend this place. This was my first time getting a hair cut without water spray to keep trimmed hair under control not to be spread everywhere in my clothes and shoes.The guy mostly used a trimmer, what he did was simply what I could do at home!The result is terrible and I cannot do anything but wait for it to grow until I can have a proper barber do a decent job.Seriously, do not even take a chance."
6/20/17,0.384375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Rita is the real deal. Every other shop was closed except this shop. Got a nice taper fade cut for $23. Aoki, the receptionist, was really nice and an AMAZING DJ. I had a great experience and now am debating driving out Santa Monica more often."
3/2/17,-0.327727273,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"If I've had the option to give them no stars I would. I do not recommend this place to anyone for the simple fact the customer service is horrible. I was given attitude for no reason, very disappointed as this location is really close to my new residence."
10/1/17,-0.144444444,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"Had a very weird experience at Eddie's and would not go back. The barber seemed inexperienced and didn't really listen to what I wanted. I tried to help him fix it but then he loudly announced to everyone in the shop that I was not satisfied and that I should leave. He didn't charge me, though I offered to pay him for his time. Left me with a really bad feeling and an imperfect haircut that had to be fixed elsewhere."
3/28/17,0.500833333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Got a great haircut from Rita. One of the best haircuts I've ever had. She took her time and made sure it was exactly how I wanted it. Will definitely be returning. Very sweet lady.
2/2/16,0.005952381,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,This place does not know how to cut a regular fade for charging me 26.00$ the fade i requested was not worth the cut. I had to go to work right after my cut and was left with cuts all over my neck and to top it off she didnt even use a blade it was done with a machine. (My guess the machine was dirty) I would have given this place 2 stars but because jason reimbursed me without a problem they get 3 stars. Never going here again
5/21/17,0.566666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Philip cut my 8 year old's son hair yesterday and it was the best cut he's ever had.  It looks great.  And Philip was a super nice guy too.  We called for an appt in advance and didn't have to wait.
8/19/15,0.159642857,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"We stopped in for a back to school haircut. The employees were sitting on the floor & eating when we arrived. Since the shop wasn't busy, I guess that was okay. But, on the floor? My 15 year old sat to have his haircut & immediately it was just clippers without care to the back of his head. He has indents and uneven bumps all over his head. I stepped in & had to tell her not to cut anymore. As he's 15 (& couldn't see the back of his head) he didn't understand my frustration & told her to keep going. She was more attentive after I intervened. However, when I asked her to fix the bumps, she looked at me as if she didn't know what I was talking about. To add insult to injury, the cost of this low quality haircut was more than supercuts! $30+ dollars Save your money. Go to real barbers who charge $20 for detail and care or at the very least supercuts or fantastic Sam's."
6/4/15,0.483333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Raphael is seriously one of the best. I've spent $$$ on haircuts before working in ""the industry"" and I can tell you that he does a better job than most. Great attention to detail, and he won't do anything that won't look good. Plus, he's a great guy to boot. If you're on the westside, this is the place, Raphael is your guy."
8/31/15,0.29,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I have been to Eddie's several times now and have always received an excellent  haircut. The staff are very polite, and even offered my dog water on a hot day. I usually go with my son who has autism. Everyone consistently shows patience and sensitivity as he requires a lot of interaction.On my last visit Rita gave both of us haircuts and did an excellent job. I highly recommend this shop."
1/11/16,0.006685185,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"I don't ever do Yelp reviews but I think my experience here is important for people to know. I've been going to this barber on and off when I'm home for vacation between semesters for about 6-8 months now. They used to have a guy named Rafael who was the man! He gave me the best haircut I've ever had. I would always call and make sure he was there before I would go in. As of the last three times I've gone he hasn't been there, and I was told he quit. Ever since then my haircuts from this place have been worse and worse. The most recent time was awful. This lady ""Jax"" cut my hair terribly and was definitely high as a kite while doing it... It took forever and she didn't take into consideration anything I was telling her. It was a major let down and I was super bummed. I'll definitely be taking my business elsewhere..."
6/20/16,0.198958333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I am very picky about my haircuts and Rita is the ONLY person in Los Angeles I will go to!! She also gives a very clean shave! Definitely recommend!!!
1/2/17,0,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,Unorganized. I called for a haircut and I was told 20 min. I asked if I should put my name in. They said no.  I came in 20 min. later and they said now it's 45 min. Life's too short and there is plenty of competition around. No business from me.
12/12/15,0.053909465,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"After a bad experience, at Weho on Friday evening I drove by this location the following Saturday morning and there was no one in there.  Got a good cut from this guy.  Was a bit too chatty for my liking, but nice enough and did a good job.  Five weeks later (today) I thought I would try my luck again.  I show up at 10:00 am music blaring and once again no one in there. ""Jackpot,"" I say to myself.  After standing at the desk for about 30 seconds, i finally shout hello over the music startling the only girl in the place.  I sarcastically say, ""turn that music down."" Which she did.  I was going to warn her about the dangers of being alone and unaware of what's going on around her, but figured, meh.I tell her I want a haircut and she looks at the computer screen for a few seconds looks up and around the empty shop and says, ""well, we were supposed to have someone in at 9:00, but he never showed. I should have someone coming in about 15 minutes if you want to wait.""I thanked her, but declined the offer.  Judging from my previous experience (read my Weho review) I just imagined some showing up in 20 or 25 minutes, not the said 15 minutes.  Upon arrival, she would have to set her stuff down, grab a coffee, get set up, etc. etc. which would last at least another 10 minutes.  In all this time, I could have been in and out, so I figured it best to not even put myself thru this and press on.It's funny, this place was open at 9:00, but wouldn't be able to provide ANY service til 10:30. That's odd to me. No wonder it was empty at 10:00 am on Saturday morning.  So, I have no complaints about the haircuts, and from the reviews not many do. It's just challenging to actually get a haircut at the barbershop."
10/8/15,0.081818182,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"Let me start off by saying the manager was a cool guy. This review is for Rita only. If I could give zero stars I would. NEVER AGAIN!!! Don't waste you're money here. I went in for a beard trim after growing it out for months and RITA completely butchered it. Patchy, uneven, and not at all what I asked for. Even with a reference picture. A 3 year old could have done a better job with their eyes closed. I immediately went home to fix it the best I could. The lines are off and I have to completely start over. Extremely disappointed. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED."
3/15/16,0.90625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I always look forward to getting my hair cut here. Rita uses excellent technique in her styling process to accomplish very creative looks. I respect the level of consistency I receive at this establishment. Would recommend!
7/20/16,0.188333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Hidden gem of a barbershop, The one in West Hollywood is much more high profile and busy, this one is low key but offers the same good service. The prices are cheaper here than WeHo, by close to $5 per item. Easy parking in back, easy to book and get in."
9/11/16,0.0978367,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,My boyfriend went in to get a line up. A clean up on his beard and head should be a simple process. The owners wife was very friendly and kind but my boyfriend came home with what looked like someone tried to slit his throat. He had cuts all over his neck. Apparently she was very heavy handed. It's unfortunate because we live around the block and thought this would be a convenient spot. He won't go back.
3/26/16,0.217857143,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Fast, friendly, cheaper than my normal place, did a great job, and did it all for a walk-in, last minute, the day before Easter. I'll definitely be coming back."
6/16/15,0.345833333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Raphael gave me a cut, very friendly and funny guy. The place is larger clean and interesting decor. Check it out!"
2/6/16,0.027954545,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"So, I'm not sure why I've been frequenting this place for the past few months. Probably the location. But I will NEVER go back. This is a very poorly run business. First, I just waited over an hour and half to get a haircut and had to walk out empty handed. The front desk people are so unprofessional. They were screaming about who is going to get new towels and no ever apologized to me about the wait. The only person who ever asked me if there was a problem... the guy flipping the sign out front. Seriously, avoid this place at all costs if you want any semblance of a good experience. There are many better options in the area!"
2/28/16,0.1053223,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,"I've had my haircut here three times now. First time was with Marty, who's actually really good. But it's been very hard to get an appointment with him. The second time was with a girl don't remember her name, the haircut wasn't my favorite but it wasn't bad. And last was just a couple days ago with an older gentleman Who I have a lot of mixed emotions with. I feel bad for him that he was so nervous. It was VERY apparent. I showed him a picture of exactly what I wanted, which was really cut and dry. A very easy and simple men's haircut I could've done in my bathroom on myself.  However, I don't blame him and his lack of experience and or schooling. It has everything to do with whoever hired him. It took over an hour for him to even trim the sides with a number 1 guard. The left side hairline is lower than the right which is about half an inch higher. So if you can imagine walking around with a lopsided head of hair, as well as two notches of hair from the back of your scalp, I'm not the happiest. My haircut takes 20-30 min max. If the hairstylist wants to tweak what I tell them I want, I don't complain, because not Everyone is going to understand. But this wasn't creative styling, just botched bad hair. Since I work in a world where you should be perfectly groomed, my hair is pretty important. The line on the nape of my neck was really crooked and there are uneven sides. Not worth the $33 bucks. Now I have to pay to have it fixed. I just paid $60 to get my hair fixed from the botched job from Eddie's salon. Make sure you research the barbers there, because there are some good ones... But by no means allow the stupid ass desk attendant to just put you with whoever.  Because I asked for a top tier barber, and he explained that they're all top tier. There's no way that they're all on the same level and I definitely won't be going back now."
2/6/16,0.022222222,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"This place sucks. Hubby once showed up for a cut 30 min after posted opening time and the doors were locked. They also don't honor Appts (once made him an appt at 2pm and he didn't get a cut at all after waiting until 3:30). What's the point of offering Appts if you don't actually pay any attention to them? I think it's so they can charge more than some crappy chain like supercuts, but the hair styling and barbering is of equal crappy quality. Their customer service is awful and the employees look and act like they have no idea what's going on. We gave it a shot because it's convenient and supposedly fast and near our place, but would rather drive much farther and pay more to never have to deal with them again."
3/28/15,0.35,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Good cut. Good price. I'll be back! Definitely check them out. Cool interiors and cool vibe.
10/8/15,-0.087395833,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"Rita doesn't even deserve this one star.. If there was an option for zero stars this would be it... She completely f'd up my boyfriends beard, she made it patchy and fucked up the shape of his beard. My boyfriend gave her a reference picture and I think she might be BLIND because she destroyed his beard that he has been growing for MONTHS. He wanted the shape of the beard to elongate his face and instead she made it round!! ZERO STARS! she not only fucked up his whole day but now it's gonna take months to grow it all out so he can get a decent shape back. Would not recommend this place at all. YOUVE BEEN WARN D.. ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!"
3/16/16,0.212125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I always have an amazing experience with Rita. She is very professional and knowledgable and is in high demand by clients. I used to let anyone cut my hair and one day I came in to this barbershop and happened to have Rita cut my hair. Ever since then I have only been going to Rita because she's taken my style to the next level. Sometimes I just get the same cut or other times I ask her to change it up a bit and I'm never disappointed with her work. This barbershop is very accommodating to its clients needs and comfort and they make you feel like you're at home. Couldn't ask for more! Go see Rita!

Clean, experienced, happy and available staff have made me look no further.  This location is what works best for me. Convenient, no need to look further.

2/17/15,0.247807239,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I will preface this review with the fact that I have not paid for a haircut in about 10 years.  My hair is not straight, but I like to keep it short and gelled, and for some reason most barbers seem to have difficulty with that, so I usually just hook myself up with a fade (2 on the side, 7 on top).That being said, I had a day off and was walking around the neighborhood when I saw this new place, so I decided to give it a shot.  I walked in and there was no wait.  Lucas took care of me and was extremely attentive and gave me the best cut I have ever paid for.  Very attentive to detail.  He used scissors for a short cut on top rather than clippers.  He even trimmed my nose hairs and a couple stray eyebrows, and used a razor to clean up the sides and back.  Total cost was an extremely reasonable $26.Everyone was very friendly, and the shop itself has a very ""hip"" feel to it.  I will definitely return and gladly pay for another cut."
5/15/16,0.496746032,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Adriana is the best barber in LA. Hands down. She knows exactly how to balance out the style you want with her own input about what looks and works best. Very flexible with timing and an absolute sweetheart.
