2/6/18,0.384722222,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"I would give this place a 2.5 if I could. I rate this based on expecting a barber cut, but it was more like a basic hair salon. That's more than good for some people, who just get a basic crew cut or a 2 blade all around.When I first walked in, literally none of barbers looked at me which made me feel very unwelcome to be honest. It wasn't until the Asian women barber called me over that I was addressed. She was actually really nice and had a good balance of friendly and not talking too much.The cut wasn't one of my best. She tried her part but I don't think they specialize in ""fr3sh kutz"". I mean, neither do I, but it's somewhere in between. I believe the haircut was $12 pre-tip, which is more than I thought it would be. I think when I was a kid this place would be perfect, but my haircut requires a little bit more finesse now."

I let my hair grow for the summer and figured I'd stop in today for a trim as I've always had a decent cut here. Place was busy and friendly as always, a new lady finished her cut and had me sit down. Trouble started almost right away after I got poked twice with the scissors....both times she apologized. She starts cutting my hair and I'm looking like L'il Beaker the rapper.....not the look I'm going for. Emma looks over and says "" What are you doing "" and the new lady kinda shrugs....""oops"".     Emma says come over to my chair and this one is on the house. She proceeds to fix my rapper look into something closer to the old surfer I am, Thank you Emma!Feel bad about the new lady but she needs to retire those scissors before someone gets hurt."
9/23/17,0.31,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,It is a simple barber shop with a good haircut for a small price.  Pleasant conversations and clean.
8/27/17,0.479166667,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,Nice friendly place and good value for money.  Monday mornings are really crowded so probably best to go at a different time.
8/6/17,0.173888889,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"So awesome to have found a local barber shop open so early on a Sunday morning. Price was exactly as advertised; $10 for a short fade/gentleman's cut. The lady that cut my hair was super friendly, as were the other ladies in the shop. I was in and out of there in about 20 minutes without compromising the haircut. It's not exactly like going to a barber shop where they give you the full service; cut, straight razor and a hot towel. However, it's a terrific place for the price. I'd go there again if I was short on time."
8/3/17,0.2125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I have been taking my son here for 7 years. You can't beat the fantastic haircuts for an unbelievable price! Gemma has been an amazing barber and has been patient & helped him come up with his own personal style throughout high school! We even moved to Newport Beach, but still drive back during 405 rush hour traffic so that she can continue to cut his hair."
7/3/17,0.131785714,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I moved to HB about 5 years ago. My son in law goes here and recommended it. I've got to say I'm amazed. I've never had a bad haircut here in the last five years. And I get a flat top. Not the easiest haircut to do. Everyone that works there is very friendly and competent. I highly recommend this place.
3/4/17,0.241666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Have come here twice now and I'm definitely never going back to supercuts again. Staff is super friendly and the prices can't be beat. :)
8/26/16,0.75,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Emma rocks! She was taught by Rochelle who also is awesome. I have had both cut my hair but Emma is my girl. She remembers how you like it done and does it well. I wouldn't go anywhere else and always recommend them. I'd pay a lot more so the price is just a bonus.
7/16/16,0.353333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I have been going to the same person to cut my hair for my whole life, but I needed a quick cut, so I figured I would give this place a shot considering it was close to my home. Shauna cut my hair and did an amazing job. I am extremely satisfied with my hair cut. I spoke with her and Rock the whole time and had a really good time chatting with them. I will definitely be coming back. Thank you for the great hair cut Shauna!"
6/1/16,0.543055556,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Steve usually cuts my hair and can hook up the fade! He is efficient and will occasionally trim my beard too. Gemma and Sarah are awesome too. They have cut my kid's hair and done great. It's got that old school barber shop feel and great price for $10. Free candy for the kiddos too! Awesome place awesome people!

1/12/16,0.017272727,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"$10 haircut! ...but the insults are FREE!!  I wanted to try a new place and their signs on Springdale got me in the door.  Their rude and unwelcoming behavior will keep me from coming back. If you want a $10 haircut that looks like a $10 haircut and don't mind the negative vibe, this is your place!"

8/22/15,0.354079254,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This place is amazing.  Probably one of the best haircuts I've ever had, and I've been to some fancy, expensive salons.  Sarah did a fabulous job.  I'm very particular about my hair, and she did exactly what I requested.  I find that the stylists at the fancier salons view themselves as artists and your hair as the canvas upon which they'll paint their next masterpiece.  Thanks, but I would rather you just do what I want.  It's my hair.  I need to live with the result.  You will get a great haircut at Springdale Barbers.  The fact that it's also fast and affordable makes an already great place even better."
3/27/15,0.32514881,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"That T.S. Person's review below mine is nonsense... I literally just had the best barber shop experience of my life. Get ahold of your kid and stop teaching him to be an entitled brat JESUS Christ. Anyway. First off all I had was quarters and they welcomed me with open arms regardless. They kept their doors open after closing and still took their time and gave me an OUTSTANDING HAIRCUT. I'm actually at the club right now and literally babes can't keep their hands off me. I had to take a bathroom break to escape the onslaught of hotties and I thought I'd write a review to pay respect to the wonderful hair cutter chicks that made this night possible. Bottom line, if you want an AWESOME DOO, and you want it for a GREAT PRICE, then look no further. I actually had Sarah cut my hair and I still have both my ears...you know why? Because I was raised by decent parents who used corporal punishment on me like good parents do. Sorry getting fired up about that jerk reviewer again. Well this place rocks, stop by for a cut."
2/28/15,-0.091601563,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"Went there today to get my son's haircut. He's been there once before. Today the blonde (who said she just moved her spot from the front to the back of the shop) cut his hair. He's 5 and does well with haircuts with an occasional squirm. Well within the first two minutes she cut his ear with the clippers!!! I understand he tilted his head a little but my biggest complaint is that not once did this lady say sorry. Instead she kept telling him that if he didn't move he wouldn't have been cut. Needless today my son cried profusely. I'm now worried because the shop and all the tools were dirty. No signs of any form of sanitizing or cleaning the clippers, scissors or combs. We will never come back here again. I hope that no one else has to experience what I did...watching your child have his ear cut because she couldn't do her job. I say this because I've taken him to many different barbers and salons along the years. Not all have been the kids salons and he has never ever been manhandled like this."

12/22/13,0.077083333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"My first time here was not that bad. I was expecting it to be a little below expectation and the barber definitely surpassed my expectation. I showed the barber a picture of what I wanted and she delivered. Also, the barber that cut my hair ended up being from South Africa which is intriguing. All in all a great experience and haircut."
10/12/13,0.463888889,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I have been coming here for years, and Richelle, Rachel, and the crew do an awesome job. They are always friendly, professional, and it's hard to beat what a great deal they offer. If you are looking for a great place to get your hair cut, check out Springdale Barbers."
9/23/13,0.3575,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,You can't go wrong with a haircut from Springdale Barbers. Men's haircuts are only $10.00 and zero fades are $11.00.  Where else can you get a quality haircut for these prices!!!  Rochelle is a great barber!  Very friendly and considerate.   Another great barber is Rachel.
9/11/13,0.557142857,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I'm a hair stylist myself but don't cut men's hair, my boyfriend and I came in here as a referral from a friend and went to Rachel. I was so impressed how she cut men's hair it actually inspired me to perfect my men's cuts. My boyfriend loved his cut and the girls made me feel so comfortable and were fun to talk to. I'm glad I have a place to refer all my clients husbands."
9/10/13,0.284953704,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Springdale Barber is HB's hidden gem!! Rochelle is a master at her craft. I'm always complimented on my hair cut and asked where I get it cut and who cuts it. One of the highlights during one of my many hair cuts is when I witnessed a young boy getting his first haircut by the same barber that cuts his dads hair. (Family tradition started:-) If you want a great haircut with a friendly, fun experience....I recommend Springdale Barbers."

I asked for a certain haircut gilbert did something totally different than what I wanted to top it off I was cut behind the ear & i got a rash with in a few minutes after leaving this place I suspect it was from the dirty clipper machine, I also like how they took down the first review I posted I'll be sure to repost it again if necessary."
8/31/13,0.164761905,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Reviews were right! Flew in from Phoenix, hit the beach then decided on a trim. Gilbert did a great job and gave me a classic, expensive looking cut for $10. Tip big! They deserve it"
7/19/13,0.060528061,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"I have been to this place 3 times now. The first time I went the vibe was great kind of intimidating by the looks of the guys with beards, tattoos. Needless to say I ended up getting one of the guys and to my surprise I got a great cut he said he had only been there for a few months but he did a great job. The hair cut even lasted longer than usual which was nice for a change ha ha. My wife loved it and I even got compliments from people I worked with and that was a surprise in itself. My first impression of the actual shop was dirty, run down, old décor, hair all over the floor. I went back my second time I got the same guy my hair looked the same great!!! This was my new spot didn't have to look anymore. It still looked dirty run down but I thought $10 good cut ill put up with it. So I went back to get a cut the other day and I noticed it was all women they said my guy was no longer there. They said somebody else can do it so I thought ill give it a shot. To make along story short my hair didn't look anything like the other times. I told her to leave it longer in certain areas. Now I don't know if I was speaking another language but she did the opposite. I will not be going back to this place any longer and the shop still looks horrible, my wife said filthy.I have one last thing to say/ask does anybody know where my guy went? I don't remember his name but he's short Hawaiian/Hispanic with a beard"
6/21/13,0.489090909,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Awesome job and service! Fast and friendly. Cant beat it for the price and good quality. My bf's new go to spot!
4/7/13,0.317687075,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I first came to this shop 12 years ago. I am particular with who cuts my hair, not that it is anything special, I just get comfortable with a barber. For the past 12 years I have had my hair cut here, and while I will wait for Mike, Steve or Sonya, if one of them is not there, or I am in a hurry, anyone can do a great job. I love this place."
3/23/13,0.285714286,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I enjoyed the atmosphere in the barber shop and was greeted as soon as I walked in the place. I'm from the South and it was my first time getting a hair cut there. Randy did a nice job on my hair and he listened to everything first before just going at it. Thanks so much guys. I will be back.
3/6/13,0.128833333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Awesome non-chain HB old school chop shop.  I've only just moved to this side of town recently and noticed these guys on the way to ACE Hardware (in the corner of the plaza- definitely check them out too if you actually have a question or need advice for the job at hand-5 stars for them too).  I'm so glad I did. They recently just had to bump up their cuts to $10 clams for dudes, not sure about the ladies, but seriously worth every dime.  Been back there 4 times now, had a different person mow my dome each time and they all have skill- evenly cut, they do what you ask them to, no blood trails afterward to speak of- in a word perfect.So do yourself a favor next time you notice you're getting too furry and check them out.  No offense to the folks that work at Sam's or the other chains but I always try to go out of my way to patronize the independent ""little guys"" whenever possible.  They HAVE to be better or they wouldn't survive and especially when they do as good or better a job for less dough.  A win-win for everybody.Finally, an example of how cool these guys are:Barber to Kid with backpack: need a haircut?Kid: yeah... but I don""t have enough money...Barber: Well whaddya got?Kid: only $9Barber: Grab a seat, I'll cover it.Cool indeed."
2/25/13,0.289583333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,This is a great barbershop! Not all fancy or salon type just a good ol fashion surf city barbershop. I usually just get a simple 3-2 buzz but they give me a straight razor shave on the back of the neck which feels fresh and clean.
1/29/13,0.254583333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Went there today. First time here. It was great. Got a nice haircut for a decent price. It is $8.50 for a regular haircut. It costs a little more if you want to go all fancy but I'm a dude so I don't need to be fancy, just decent enough. Leave the fancy to the pretty ladies."

1/18/11,0.171666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Cheap hair cut, fast service. If you have a simple look like me, no need in going to some high class salon and paying 20 bucks or more. Since they only charge $8.50, I usually give a higher tip, win win for everyone. One complaint would be when you are getting your haircut they face you towards everyone who is waiting, it's like having an uncomfortable staring contest."
5/27/10,0.191477273,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"This place is a great balance of cost and quality. They didn't give me the best haircut I've ever had, but for $8.50, they did a great job and I will be back.So the first time I stopped in here, the barber got a little preachy with me. He spent a good 5 minutes talking to me about how Jesus was helping him cut my hair and how god healed his finger when he knicked it while cutting someone else's. It got weird. He did a decent job and was friendly...the conversation was just uncomfortable at best. I was a bit concerned that the whole staff might be like that and while I can appreciate it, I just want my hair cut.When I came back a few months later, I learned that the first barber I'd had was let go and my second barber, who'd been around for six years, was great. It took 15 minutes to cut the mop I had on my head in half and it looked good."
