I saw the reviews on here, and figured I'd give it a shot. I was not disappointed. I would recommend Black and Gold any day. Kevin took my appointment on short notice, took his time, and gave me the best cut I've had in awhile. I don't have to look any further because Black and Gold is my new spot."
2/14/18,0.386458333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I really enjoy coming into Black & Gold Barber Lounge. All the barbers there are super friendly and welcoming when you walk in. My goto barber there is Kevin aka Kevinjoi aka LaFlare! Great guy and his craft has definitely gotten better and better each time. I would call sometime in the middle of the week and see if he has any openings during the evenings and he always finds time to squeeze me in between his appointments or stays later. Definitely appreciate it! Go to Kevin if you are ever looking for a barber to make you feel good and look good! Best prices in town.

He always does his best to accommodate my crazy inconsistent schedule, and treats me like a brother. Any style I ask him for, he always comes through. I love the atmosphere at the shop. The conversations, the laughs, the music. You'll never get that at Supercuts ‍ just saying.."
7/15/17,0.254166667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Great barber shop! Jamie is my usual barber and hooks it up every time. I've had cuts by a few other guys there too and they come with it too. Def my best experience since moving to San Francisco so far.

I found Black and Gold while I was scrolling through Yelp and I was confident to drive out to try the place. I just got my first cut with Mark and he cut my hair perfectly just the way I wanted it. He didn't rush, he took his time and it was cool to get to know him on a personal level. I'm definitely coming back and it feels good that I finally found a barber."

The barbers here really make you feel at home and the setup there is super dope. Victor Salvador, one of the barbers at this shop is my go to guy. He always takes his time and pays attention to all the details when cutting my hair. I've known this guy since he was cutting hair for fun in his basement 10 years ago and not only has his barber skills develop drastically over the years but who he is as a person has as well. Every time I'm sitting in his chair we always share some laughter and have meaningful conversations about life. Not only do I look good but feel good after a cut from him. In the before picture of me below was what I was rockin' before I let Victor touch my hair. As you can see in the after picture yo boy can finally go out in public without people laughing at me. 5 stars to a great barbershop with one of my favorite barbers to ever to do it."

No matter what you need in the way of the proper barber for your needs they got a chair that will flip your wig! Plus the shop has that barber shop talk, jokes, fun and plenty of parking. Make sure to call... They stay busy, make sure to call."

3/11/17,-0.46875,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"This place should be called ""Feel like Cuts"" because obviously they didn't feel like cutting my hair. Scheduled an appointment and barber never showed up. Waited over an hour!!"
2/10/15,0.161087768,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Mark is the man! Before I started getting my hair cut from him I used to have my brothers cut my hair. But from now on no one cuts my hair but my professional barber Mark! He's a beast! It's always good talkin shop with this guy. Funny down to earth man. Even if I lived 100 miles away I would still walk, drive, fly, sail, bike, swim, scooter my ass to get a cut from him.  But enough about Mark. All the barbers at black n gold are legit! All cool guys! From kids to male and female whoever they'll get the job done! But you better call a few days in advanced they're so good they get booked quick and you don't want a supercutz cut because you lagged on making an appointment. From fades to combovers to sick designs black and gold got you! Make those appointments!"

But Samer really knows how to disappoint. I will never ever come back here again. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH SAMER/SAM. He is the worst barber ever."
4/3/17,0.24,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Coming from LA, this is definitely the best barbershop I've found in the Bay. Make sure you call and set up an appointment and pay for a quality cut. I've been getting cut by Jamie the last couple months and haven't had one complaint."
4/11/15,0.186929293,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been consistently going here for the past 2 years and I've always been satisfied every time. Even though it is appointment only, they are all so welcoming and just positive vibes. I highly recommend Victor Salvador, one of the youngest and most genuine in the shop. Knowing him through his progression over the years from cutting hair in the garage to the shop, he'll definitely blend you up real nice and have you looking A1. Really a cool dude to chop it up with and all smiles.Shoutout to all the other talented barbers, Derrick, mark, Sam, Kevin, and Rodney. Black and gold is the place to get cut if you're in Daly City! Yee!#BABB"
3/22/17,0.0875,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Jamie cuts me here at B&G and he always does a really good job in cutting my hair exactly how I want it. Definitely recommend them.

4/22/15,0.1615625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been to a countless amount of barbershops in my life, but none come close to the comfort and performance of Black and Gold. Walking into a barbershop can be an intimidating venture, but not here. Every barber greets you once you step in and out of those doors.I've been going to my boy, Victor Salvador, for over 3 years now. Vic is a young dude, but his haircuts will leave you thinking he's done this for years. To be honest, I receive constant compliments about how nicely my hair is cut and I know it's because Vic puts his blood, sweat, and years into perfecting his craft. My cut is a comb over with a skin-tight fade.I highly recommend visiting one of the other 5 barbers in the shop. Derrick is notoriously known for cutting hair. Rod, Mark, Sam, and Kev are always fully booked and I've seen them bless their clients on the regular. The Bay Area is a hot bed for the best barbers in the world. I believe that Black and Gold offers the best collection of that talent. Upgrade your barbershop experience, and give Black and Gold a call."
7/18/15,0.307805195,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Recently moved to Daly City and needed a new barber. Found B&G on Yelp. Called in on Wednesday afternoon, scheduled appointment for Saturday morning. Came in on the minute and was seated right away, no extra wait time. Atmosphere is friendly, lots of jokes flying around.Mark was very attentive and made sure he understood exactly the kind of haircut I wanted, and was then able to deliver exactly that. I'm very happy with the result and will definitely be back for next time. Highly recommended!"

Nas"
6/5/15,0.370749639,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I just moved to Daly city, and one of the hardest things about moving is finding a new barber.  Luckily, I had yelp to guide me in the right direction.  I called in and scheduled an appointment with mark.  Just a heads up, the place is cash only.  Anyway, I went in, got a hair cut, and it was awesome.  I was really vague about how I wanted my hair, but Mark made it look great!  Definitely an awesome barber and easy to work with.  I highly recommend Mark.  I haven't gotten a cut from anyone else but the atmosphere was great and everyone was nice and accommodating.  Will definitely come back.  Thanks Mark!!"
7/21/15,0.150119048,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Clean,  professional, punctual, and nice with the blades.  I have been in my share of barber shops and it's typically the same story...barbers unprofessional by taking several trips to the bathroom,  texting,  or simply talking with other barbers so much they forget you're in chair. Not at Black and Gold, Mark was courteous and respect of my time.  We still had good conversation,  but he was not distracted and making a 30-45 minute haircut an hour plus ordeal.  I'll be a returning customer and highly recommend Mark and Black and Gold barber shop."
5/26/16,0.263425926,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I've known Victor Salvador for years but never knew he cut hair until I heard from a mutual friend. Decided to go to him about a year ago and never looked back! I usually get a tapered comb over with a hard part and I always get compliments on how nice the cuts are. A friend even wanted to know where I get my cuts at and is about to get his first cut with Vic! Always takes his time and would be more than glad to answer any questions or explain things you might be unsure about.Clean environment and awesome haircuts every time I go there! Definitely would recommend this place to anyone!
5/29/15,0.3328125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"If you guys ever need a fresh cut, this is the place to go. They only go by appointments so make sure you call them early in the week. This barber shop has a great environment and the barbers are more than likely cracking jokes and giving off good vibes. I usually get my hair cut by Vic. His cuts are always top notch which shows his experience and versatility  with clippers. He also makes sure that all his customers leave happy and satisfied. I've been to other barber shops around Daly City and San Bruno and I haven't found a barber lounge that would be comparable to this one. Besides the fact that they don't take walk-ins, everything else about this place keeps me going back for more cuts."
9/10/16,0.320635331,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I don't know why I never took my son to this shop before!!  Read a lot of Yelp reviews and this place had good things said about them, so gave them a try.  We live a few blocks away so it's close to us, walking distance.  Made my son an appt and he got Mark.  He did an excellent job, he was fast and did exactly what I asked him to do.  My son was so happy that for the first time a barber DID NOT cut him, he's 7.  So that's a big plus!!!  I'm definitely bringing my son here from now on.  Thanks!!!"
10/21/15,0.182291667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Samer Dabai is pretty awesome. In fact, they all are. This place looks like a hot maid service comes by every hour and cleans it. They take their time with each costumer, attention to detail. When you're on the cutting chair, you're all that matters. These guys know what they're doing and will give exactly what you want, if not better. Do make an appointment. Cost? $20! Results?  Worth $50 or more. Personality/service of these barbers? Worth more than your lousy 21% tip. Thanks Sam!"
9/29/14,-0.007744709,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,"Ugh this place. Like the girl that you're in love with that keeps sleeping with your best friend. Seriously I am in the forever friend zone with this place and can not get past 1st base most of the time. And by that I mean get a hold of anyone to get an appointment :(The first time, called multiple times but no one picked up phone. Finally drove myself down there and after an awkward moment of me walking in and everyone looking at me... asked if there was any room for a walk-in. Nope. Anyone have room for an appointment? More awkwardness until one of them checked his books and he had time early the next morning. SWEET. 2nd base achieved.The next morning got my cut, we even got done way early before the place was listed as being open. Guys were chill and funny as hell with their conversation. I really dug my cut, asked the guy for his card so maybe I could yknow make this an exclusive relationship... cause that's how we roll right? No more awkward walk-in attempts? He gave me his number instead. Cool.Weeks later I try to hit him up with no response. Damn. Square one. I've been friend zoned again lol.If it wasn't for the craziness of trying to get a hold of someone for an appointment, this place would be perfect. Seriously take my money!"
5/24/16,0.260956101,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Just got a cut by Mark.  I made a super last-minute appointment and got lucky because they took me the same day (but don't rely on this, because they do get booked out days in advance; call a few days ahead).The shop feels nice and open and is clean.  Everyone has a really nice, chill vibe.  I felt right at home.Mark is a true artist and his attention to detail and skill set was very impressive.  I had a serious head of hair going on and with very little guidance by me, he knew exactly what to do.  It looks great and my wife loves it!   I will be returning to Black & Gold"
9/28/14,0.304583333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,There is so much i can say about this place so i might as well do so. I came into this place because my friend's had a little pop up Vape shop inside. After visiting a few times i finally decided to get a nice haircut there. After setting up an appt. with Derrick I realized this is going to be good. After sitting in the chair and trusting in my barber I realized man this guy knows exactly what he is doing. He took the time to get the perfect blend and was very precise on the clean up. I walked out with a huge smile on my face and a awesome haircut. Ever since that day I have gone to this shop for a clean cut. Black & Gold literally makes me feel at home and I seriously trust anyone in the shop with my hair. Please book an appt. with them because their books fill up quick! Thanks for always taking care of me guys!

12/4/15,0.267142857,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Found them on yelp. Came in since my normal barber shop couldn't get me in. I didn't have an appointment or anything and Kevin took me in right away. Got a good cut real attention to detail. I'll be comming back. Kevin was the MVP of the day

5/18/16,0.16875,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,My son got a great cut. 5 stars to Kevin. O stars for the other barber who starting vaping...some may say vaping is not smoking but you know what..neither i nor my son who has asthma need to be inhaling either. Maybe out of courtesy he should step outside and vape.
9/26/16,0.3159375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Sam is a beast with the blade and clippers. One of the BEST in the Bay. I have seen the other barbers cut and they have skills too!! Professional and friendly atmosphere at all times . I drive 45mins to get my haircut and it's worth it.
3/5/16,0.114285714,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,One of the few places I've went to for a haircut. Don't really trust anyone cutting my hair but I gave this place a shot because someone really recommended it as one of the best spots. Haven't been anywhere else since. Mark is a really dope barber and definitely recommend him.
1/6/16,0.340909091,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I was looking around the area for a new barber and remembered this place since a friend of mine used to go here until his barber moved. Scheduled an appointment with Mark (they're appointment only),came in that day not knowing what to get. i asked him questions on what he thought would look best. i gave him full trust and went straight into it. Came out of it with a dope haircut and i loved it. Definitely will be coming back!"
9/24/15,0.246212121,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Definitely the nicest barber shop I've seen in the Bay Area. Just moved up here from SoCal, been looking for a new barber home and black & gold has for sure got me coming back. Mark has gotta be the most thorough barber I've ever had. He takes his time and makes sure you leave the shop fully satisfied."
8/11/15,0.128636364,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I was referred to this place from a friend and I've been going back for over a year now even though I live in American Canyon. Rodney is the man. He puts his best foot forward and is very accommodating. Appointments are almost recommended no matter what day of the week you come in. Parking can be an issue, but I usually roll up on my motorcycle to avoid all of that. Prices are pretty much in line with other barber shops, but what differs from other shops I've been to is the atmosphere. Just chill and relaxing with informative conversations."
3/12/14,0.325,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I personally go to Rodney but I think everyone here has got their 'barbering skills' on point. The dudes here personify the definition of NICE; in terms of their skills, their style, and their overall demeanor/personality. They make anyone that comes through the door feel welcome and part of the family.   If you want your cut fresh and exactly as you ask with your barber taking his time and not rushing it, set up an appointment with Rodney and bring your untamed head to B&G."
5/15/15,0.31921875,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"What can I say about Rodney... Other than, this guy is amazing and off the hook! He always make sure he have time to cut my hair. Setting up an appointment is EASY I tell you. You just need to get his business card and send him a text message on what day you want to come in. Yup it's that easy!!! I mean What more can you asked for? Overall experience, ROD is legit, funny and cool ASS spot to kick it... Kinda Makes you feel like you at home."
4/22/14,0.145777778,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Even though my barber, Mark, overbooked and ran behind schedule, he was poised to cut my hair within a 30-minute time frame. I had also told him that I was going to rush to my grandpa's house after the haircut to take him to a doctor's appointment. If that were not enough pressure, he was also burdened with difficult clients trying to book appointments over the phone. Nevertheless, here are three reasons why Mark and this urban barbershop deserves five stars: 1) Preciseness: He followed all of my meticulous, knit-picky instructions down to a tee with remarkable precision.  2) Honesty: When I requested for a Comb-over cut, he gave me a frank assessment that because my hair wasn't long enough, the top would not rest properly on the side towards which it would be combed. He then showed me photos of alternative cuts I could choose from, most of which would better fit my given hair length. 3) Excellence: Mark must have spent at least 20 minutes blending my hair with different sized clippers to achieve a near perfect bald fade. This was probably one of the top five haircuts I've ever had in my life. Every aspect--whether it be the lineup, the seamless blend of the fade or the trimming of the top--was close to flawless. If you want to walk out of a hairstyling establishment looking fresh and clean without the fear of a bad hair day resulting from stylistic blunders, then head over to Black and Gold."
11/28/14,0.475,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I highly recommend Mark! I moved to the bay area two months ago and have been searching for a skilled, reliable and personable barber. Mark is the best I've found, again, I highly recommend him!"

I was a little scared since I have thick, straight hair but he did a good job and consistently asked if he was hurting me when tapering the back. Good environment, the shop is kept clean, and they play good music lol. Mark isn't an annoying barber that just talks BS all day either, which was nice. I'll definitely be coming back."
11/7/15,0.590277778,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I needed a haircut and beard trim after playing golf nearby and Black & Gold delivered! These guys  know how to provide a great salon experience to men women and children. I called at 430 on a Tuesday & they got me in the chair by 530. Appointments are recommended. I think it was $30 which seemed really fair for the hour I was in the chair and the attention to detail. It ended up looking awesome -- probably one of the best haircuts I've gotten ever. Thanks BG!

Unless, as other reviewers have mentioned, you do not mind below average service and an obvious lack of interest in the customers over money, then this place will at best satisfy you.

9/19/13,0.355137845,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Went to Black & Gold for the first time early this year, and have come back consistently every two weeks since. They're that good. Since coming here I've never thought about going anywhere else. Every time I get a cut it's flawless work by Mark. He's my go-to-guy for a cut. No matter where I am in the bay, I'd commute FAR to get a cut from him. I got some difficult ass hair to work with, I always need it a certain way, and I've been to my fair share of barber shops around the bay, but let me tell you, Mark is the best by FAR. Every cut I get from him, I don't even need to worry anymore because it always comes out flawless and exactly how I ask. Whatever you need whether it's a faux hawk, taper, fade, combover, etc, he will NOT disappoint. Moreover, he has great customer service, and will always make the effort to accommodate you to your own convenience. I will continue to get my haircut from Mark as long as I'm in the bay, and I don't plan on moving anywhere any time soon. I give the highest recommendation for him, primarily because if he's kept lowkey, it'd just be an insult to his skill."

Everyone is super friendly, the vibe and environment is great, all the barbers are cool and great at what they do. This shop is usually very busy so you should always make an appointment. I always have a great experience here. I go to Victor Salvador here at B&G. I recommend booking an appointment with him. He always tries to find time to fit you in his schedule and always takes care of his clients. He does a great job on my hair and does everything I want. He's great on all kinds of haircuts and will take time on your hair to make sure he did his best job. He will not disappoint you!!!"

So I have two of my cousins that came in from Mexico and they've never been to a barbershop so I decide to make them an appointment black and gold with the barber SAM. HUGE mistake. When arriving to the appointment. Sam said  ""they're mother called to cancel"" WTF!? Not only Sam made up some ridiculous excuse to not comply with his clients but his approach to this was childish and unprofessional. To all of those that need a barber. I suggest going to Super Cuts instead Sam of Black & Gold. Waste of my time."

His tapers, fades and line ups are clean and as picky as I am I never leave disappointed."

Firstly, the Giants game was on! I always feel like getting my haircut is a chore, but no more. Secondly, everyone is laid back and hella nice. Lastly, I got a clean haircut. The best I've had in a long time. THANKS HUBERT!I will definitely get my hair cut again by Hubert, likely during a ball game."
7/25/14,0.121562049,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Black & Gold Barber Lounge is my new barbershop.A skilled, professional and consistent barber who knows how to cut African American hair is, at least for me, so difficult to find in the SF bay area (unless you are willing to travel to the east  or south bay). After I viewed some head shots on Yelp at Black and Gold Barber Lounge my interest was peaked.  So, I scheduled an appointment  with Sam for a hair cut and beard trim. The appointment was schedule during my lunch hour. So I was hoping it would be precise and quick.Once I arrived at t Black and Gold Barber Lounge, I was impressed. The shop was bright, with large windows and natural light. Most important, I was clean as well decorated. Yes, this stuff matters, at least for me. I also noticed the other barbers cutting other clients, including two other African Americans and their hair cuts looked great too!Sam, the barber, got to me at my scheduled appointment time. Again, impressed. Sam has mad skills. He hooked me up right!. Same provided neat, clean and precise temple tapered cut and razor lined my sides and beard. I was very satisfied with his services. Sam gets my personal 5 star rating. Thanks Sam! The only reason I did not rate Black and Gold Barber Lounge with 5 stars is because I noticed one of the barbers who was cutting a client's hair was either texting or answering his phone. This is a major annoyance for me. It usually increases the time the client has to be in the barber's chair, which is not a win-win for the client or barber.  Hopefully, the management will address this issue.Great first impression and fantastic hair cut, lining and bread trim. I'll be a returning client at Black and Gold Barber Lounge."

11/12/14,0.01,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,My husband and youngest son went in for a cut a few weeks ago. I think we found a spot they can keep going back to. Showed Mark a picture of what I wanted my youngest son to get and he did the job! Thanks again! They'll definitely be coming back!
12/20/13,0.068386243,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"Decent place to get a haircut ONLY for younger guys with hip hop style. The people here find hanging out and smoking hookah vaporizer is more important than actually running a business. Now down to the specifics. I have been there 3 times hoping that I had found my ""go to"" Barbershop but after my most recent visit will certainly be my last. Why? Because:1) set an appointment for a specific time and still had to wait 20 minutes before getting cut. There's a reason why people set up appointments and these guys don't get that2)  my barber stopped cutting my hair to go and take shots in the back room! Are you kidding me? 3) no people skills. The people that talk to each other are the ones who go there everyday. Good luck having a conversation with one of them if you're not a regular.4) no haircut skills. Being decent with clippers is one thing but put scissors in their hands and its a whole nother ball game for these guys. Bottom line:  good haircuts are an afterthought to this place. Look elsewhere for barbers who take their craft seriously!"

1/20/12,0.375757576,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I obviously normally don't yelp (can you tell?) but felt that this one was a must...I've been a customer of Derrick's for about 5-6 years now and can't imagine being cut by anyone else.  If I could give it 6 stars, I would.  Derrick makes sure that you're happy with the results and will remember exactly how to cut you the next time you go back.  I'm a bit OCD with my haircuts, so it says a lot that I've been 100% happy with my cut every time.  And I go every week.His new location/shop has a welcoming and elegant vibe to it.  It's definitely above and being what you would normally expect from a normal barber shop and is deserving of it's name ""Lounge"".  I guess that makes sense since it isn't just ANY barber shop.  If you want to get a great quality haircut with great service, this is the place to go."
10/9/13,0.441666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Black and gold is one of the best places to get a hair cut in the entire Bay Area.  Staff are friendly and give some of the best cuts I've seen.  I always go to Mark and I'm going to continue doing so!

Everything is brand new from the floors to the chairs..it's truly a REAL barbershop!! Coming from the east coast it was hard to find barbershops like those back home because most of the shops here are small and kind of the hole in the wall type! But B & G reminds me of the shops on the east coast, nice leather couches, TV and drinks available. Plenty of room to kick back while you wait for a cut.Just a heads up...make sure you book an appointment with either Derrick or Rodney cause they are busy all the time!!"

4/15/14,0.243194444,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Black and Gold is definitely highly recommended.  Every barber there is friendly and the entire place is very welcoming.  Mark is my go to barber every 2-3 weeks now.  He's got skills with the bald fade and beard lineups.  I even bring my 12 year old nephew who loves getting his haircut now.  Every barber there has skills though and it doesn't take long to notice.  They put time into every client and the proof is in the pics on Yelp. They have a by appointment only system which works great.  You never have to wait that way and it allows them to make sure you aren't rushed.  I've been to several barbers in SF and surrounding areas and this one ranks the best in my opinion.
10/17/14,0.242121212,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Went in on Tuesday to get my haircut after 2 years of growing it out. I was referred to Mark by a friend and I am very happy with the results. He was very professional but also a really cool dude. Understood exactly what I was looking to get and even suggested a few improvements that really made the haircut worth the $25. The shop is very well kept and the location is nice as well. Will definitely be recommending Black and Gold to my friends.

I come here to see Mark every time I need to get faded (minus the alcohol), but you can't really go wrong with anyone at this shop. All the barbers got BARS and got their clipper game on lock. Be sure to call ahead to schedule an appointment."

The place itself is roomy, clean, and the whole staff is friendly as well. I have been getting cut by Hubert and he is always on point! Hubert is very detailed and will make sure you leave very satisfied. He knows what he is doing and will cut your hair however you want it. He also uses a hot towel after facial hair trim (which is really refreshing) and uses a massager after your cut. Overall this place is worth the money for a clean cut and I recommend getting cut by Hubert! You can walk in, but I also suggest calling in for an appointment as they are usually busy!"

Looking for a new barber I called Black and Gold one day asking about appointments and Mark picked up. I set an appointment with him and got my haircut. Mark is a really good barber and person he has good conversation and works around my schedule. He's great at what he does, he is laid back but very professional too. If your ever looking for a new barber Black and Gold has great ratings on yelp you cant go wrong with any of the barbers here but in my opinion just do a little extra and ask to speak with Mark. You will not be disappointed."
