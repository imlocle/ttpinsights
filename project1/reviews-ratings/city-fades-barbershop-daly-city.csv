7/7/17,0.591666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Husband and son went in for a haircuts with Sushi! I am very happy with his work. One of the best cuts my son has ever gotten. We have gotten a bunch of compliments. It's a clean cut. Will definitely be back and will be recommending friends and family.
12/11/17,-0.147222222,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,I heard good things about this barbershop so I decided to walk in on Monday afternoon. There was one Barber working on a fade that took 45 minutes. After it was done I got in the chair and he asked if I had an appointment and proceeded to tell me 'tough luck' because I wasn't 'alan' and that I needed an appointment. I politely said nobody told me when I walked in and was waiting for almost an hour that I needed an appointment. They didn't even apologize or offer to cut my hair. Worst experience at a barbershop in the Bay Area by far. Do not go here.

Halfway through the haircut, I realise he has completely shaved off my side burns and given me a taper at the back, none of which I asked for. The final haircut was nothing like the picture and I am very unhappy with it. I would not recommend this place if you have something specific in mind because they just gave me whatever they felt like."

Finally found my barbershop in the area.. very low key place and very affordable.. you will definetly going to give good tip because you can really tell that they are very proud of their work.. highly recommended for people who are looking for quality haircut in a very nice price.. street parking but easy to find one..
3/3/17,0.133333333,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,Went in for a cut one night and was squeezed in for a good fade. Called 2 weeks later got an appointment for 11 am. Was texted at 8pm the night before to show up at 12 noon. No big deal. Showed up at 12 waited a half an hour and barber still hadn't shown despite me texting and he saying he's on his way. Would not recommend.
8/7/15,-0.273,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"I came here about two weeks ago. I told the guy very clearly, I DO NOT WANT TO COMB MY HAIR. After an hour of listening about weed and lifting, the guy hands me a mirror and says you're going to have to comb your hair. Then he tells me the cost is 25 USD. I left with no tip. When I got out one of their neighbors was blocking my car. I left looking like Robin from the Batman Animated Series from the 90's with a horrible line up. Come here if you want potheads that don't know how to take instructions to cut your hair. I wish I could give negative stars. P.S. They play tacky hip hop."
7/15/16,-0.010297619,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"If I can give 0 stars I would. Everyone here that's given them 5 stars are all friends of theirs. You can tell by how they wrote their review. I called early in the day to make an appointment. More like the morning. The guy ""San"" or ""sam"" w.e... made an appointment for 5pm. I get there at 450pm. I wait about until 520pm just cuz all the barbers were cutting hair still when I got in. So when the time comes for me to ask... why is it taking so long. I had an appointment at 5pm. And ""San"" tells me to come back in a couple of hours. WTF. and I asked why and he tells me two other guys are in front of me. And I was waiting there longer than all the other people that came in after. Super unprofessional.  Don't accept and make an appointment if your going to tell them to come back in a couple of hours. Overall. Ima stick with the cutlery. They are professional and they do get upset if the clients are late. Vs city fades that tells you to come back in a couple of hours from your appointment. And all they talked about was Weed and I heard one of em asking for CHP. Yep. This is probably one of the first few of many 1 stars to come to this business. The guy gave me his card also as I left. I threw the weak ass card away right when I stepped out of the barbershop."

10/16/14,0.281886574,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Best barbershop in the San Francisco and Daly City hands down! Great atmosphere, wifi hotspot, and it's connected to a shoe store!! I went in with my boyfriend, barbershops usually make me uncomfortable because I'm a girl but the vibe in this shop is super chill. My boyfriend got a low taper fade from Henry and he looked sexy!  I even got to use their free wifi, so I didn't have to waste my data. I stream a lot. My bf also got a good deal on a pair of rare sneakers. Two thumbs up! Ask for Henry!"

7/24/15,0.106060606,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Been out of town for a while so I needed a new shop. Atmosphere is laid back. Got cut by Henry and he did a solid job. Didn't rush got the lil details and made sure he have me the cut that I wanted. 5 star spot that I'll be coming back to on the regular.
7/4/15,0.405555556,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Called around on the 4th of July and every barber shop fully booked.  Got lucky and Stan at City Fade Barber Shop got me in. 1st time getting a haircut in a loooolong time and great experience. Didn't know what I wanted but showed Stan a picture of the cut. He took a look and said OK then BOOM he gave me what I wanted.  Great price, laid back atmosphere. Will be back again!"
