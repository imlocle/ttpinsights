2/28/18,0.413494318,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"Found my new salon! I came in with a hair disaster and Justine worked her magic and gave me the most beautiful balayage/ ombre coloring ever. Justine won't let you walk out of the salon until you're happy and to say that I was happy is an understatement; I was over the moon ecstatic with the results of my hair. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE of my friends and family commented on my hair the days following (and still do!). If you're thinking of adding excitement to you hair, Justine is your gal!"
1/19/18,0.224475108,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"I don't really write reviews but I am over the Moon happy with the results of my new doo! I've had long, dyed hair my whole life and was extremely skeptic at first if I should go through with cutting my hair or not but after a previous bleach job that fried my hair I decided I needed a change. I read a bunch of reviews and searched through dozens of pictures. After reading through some reviews about Ashley Sue I decided to book my appointment. I got a call next day from her and she talked me through the process and asked me to send photos and gave me great feed back if this was the right look for my facial features. I didn't want someone who just agreed with everything I asked for and wanted my business but someone who will give me real critical feedback. Ashley Sue was straightforward and honest with me about everything from color, length, and even showed me how I can style short hair afterwards!Go to Ashley Sue! She does amazing work! What a wonderful experience."

My hair was left undamaged and the color looks the exact same from 6 weeks ago. They also use all the best products and sell them at the front. Check out Justine's instagram @justineraestyles for proof of her talent and dedication ‍"
2/22/18,0.411607143,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,I went there to get my hair done by Ashlee sue she is amazing and I'm so happy with my haircut and color she's totally approachable and really friendly. She knows what she is doing! I was going for an icy silver look and I'm really happy with our first session and how it turned out!

I came in with about 2 inches of dirty blonde regrowth and solid yellowish hair beyond the regrowth and I left with beautifully blended, bright creamy blonde hair with great dimension. I am so happy with the results, they'll make you say WoWza for sure. Thanks again Justine!!!Also, the salon is super cute and booming with a cool atmosphere and nice people. I will definitely be back!"
2/9/17,0.102941176,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,"What I had: long (like to my butt), thick, coarse Asian hair in the shape of a V but with too many layers in the middle.What I was looking for: about 2 inches taken off to give it a healthy look and to also even it out so there weren't so many layers in the middle but to keep the same V shape. Bang trim and some thinning.What I got: short, blunt cut. V shape was gone.What I got (2nd chance): short, choppy, uneven layers. Still no V shape.Pretty bummed. Was hoping this salon would be my go-to, but unfortunately won't be back. Looks great in a pony tail! So that'll be my hairstyle for the next 6 months before I let anyone take shears to it again..."

I stopped the hairdresser mid way through to say that this was not what I wanted and it was too short, and was assured it would be ok... It wasn't. I can't even get my hair into a ponytail to hide the bad cut.... will never be back..."

4/16/17,0.004615385,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,"To keep it short and sweet. This place is way over priced and completely ruined my hair. I came here with high expectations bc of such great ratings. I had long dark brown hair expecting to get a blonde balayage but left with bleached streaks. I paid 210$ for literally 7 random pieces of my hair bleached and ""toned"". When I asked if the rest of my hair was going to get bleached my hair stylists said ""no"". My hair was fried and looked disgusting... Sydney did my hair. I showed her a picture of what I wanted (which I will post) and it turned out nothing like the image AT ALL. She was sweet but as a hair stylist I would not recommend going to her."

1/4/18,0.4125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,Studio fifty fifty is the real deal. There's not to many places in the OC where you experience quality service and a welcoming atmosphere. Plus some yummy cookies and wine. Thank you silvanna!
11/22/17,0.104821429,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"""Hair emergency? What?? There is no emergency in hair!""Let me tell you: THERE IS. And you can believe me, because I'm really not the type of person to have a hair emergency. In fact, until this week, I didn't think hair emergencies were a thing.I walked into this place with my hair an ACTUAL disaster. I mean, a non professional, bleached my hair. It was orange... IN PATCHES. I mean... I must have looked like a McFrickin cheetah. And this was the week of Thanksgiving. I mean, I love my family... but let's not lie: a lot of people have a firm belief that holidays are for judging. My family are those people a little bit (a lot). Also, photos are forever. So, I was a little stressed.I walk in to Studio 50/50. Kean Rager takes one look at my hair, and just *fixes it.* The man didn't sweat a drop. Just made it happen. The phrase ""miracle worker"" comes to mind. He didn't talk my ear off, listened while I complained about things, we talked when we wanted to, it was no pressure. Plus, watching his hands go was awesome.My hair looks VERY nice, and I'm really happy with his work. Ask for Kean! He's awesome!"

Albertsons, flower shops in Newport Beach but these flowers Dianne makes last over 2 weeks! They smell so good and my wife ALWAYS knows when I don't get her flowers from Studio Fifty Fifty. Guys...save yourself a headache and $...go and see Dianne. Oh and the candles they have are AWESOME. Smell a good. One last bit of advice..try and get your order in early. Dianne gets tons of orders and it's always nice to give her some time to make your arrangements special. My wife and youngest son see BROOKE. She is such a sweetheart. My son is 6 and doesn't want anyone touching his hair but Brooke is so nice and he warms up to her! My wife goes to Brooke and she Always leaves happy. Everyone at Studio Fifty Fifty is sweet and welcoming. Not to mention I can shoot the shit with some of the people their and have a beer! This place is awesome."
9/6/17,-0.003803938,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,"I've contemplated leaving this review for several months now. I had a bad experience. I went in for balayage touch ups and a trim and walked out with a very brassy full weave. This stylist agreed to do balayage. She has been with the studio since they opened (she said). This is a supposed high-end salon. I apparently confused her with my straightforward request. I came back for a correction. She used an ashy toner over the hair instead of painting back the brown I requested. I was shocked that I now had grey hair. I had to hold back tears. She was not happy that I was not happy still, but said I confused her AGAIN. We're both native English speakers so I don't know what this is about. She asked me if the cut was ok. I said yes because I was not going to allow her to put scissors to my hair again. I left never to return. The toner washed right out. My hair was very damaged considering it was a full weave instead of some balayage highlights. I went back to my old hair dresser (I moved away which was why I was looking for a new one) and she fixed my cut and gave me advice on how to treat my hair so it stops breaking. I don't think this is a high end salon and everyone is cramped up against each other. No one with proper training would not be able to understand the difference between regular foil highlights which are weaved uniformly throughout the hair and balayage, a technique where highlights are hand painted freehand. Oh and by the way, I came out with two toned hair as well. The place has a big sign that says no refunds. I gave her a chance, but hair, once damaged, does not heal and I didn't want to completely destroy it."

7/6/17,0.097478992,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"I wish there are negative points so I can rate this store. I make appt at 7:30pm and leave my work one hour earlier to make this. They called me twice to confirm the time and ask my Credit card info in case I cancel. And then they called me three hours earlier to ask if I can reschedule earlier- I say I can't. And I arrive there 5 mins before the appt time. They told me that it's gonna be a 20 mins wait cuz she is finishing up the one before me- I was not happy but I think it's fine and understandable. And 40 mins pass, nobody shows up. My hair stylist is still taking care of her customer. Cashier asks me if I wants to purchase any hair product bcoz she is closing her computer. Wanna make sure I don't need any extra purchase.This is not right.  If you are gonna charge me if I cancel the appt within 24 hours, then  I should charge u for delaying the appt without any notice and have me waiting there for more than half hours. They saw me left angrily. And didn't even say a sorry.I am sure they do great haircut. But plz learn to respect your customer first."
7/23/16,0.141130051,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"I should preface this by saying I have never colored my hair anything but a natural brown. And while Erin was great at that, I think the real moment where she surprised me was when I decided I wanted to add red to my hair.I'm typically pretty specific with my hair because I've had one or two bad experiences (not here) in the past. Anyway, I told Erin I wanted red in my hair and while I had a bit of sticker shock when the dye went in, I was so happy with how it came out!! I feel like a completely new woman! The atmosphere of the salon is pretty cool. There's cookies and water readily available for your indulgence whereas other salons have that kind of hidden. And depending on the time of year, it's themed! So you'll have orange frosted cookies during Halloween and red white and blue frosted cookies during 4th of July, etc.The chairs are comfortable--even the ones where they rinse your hair. So that's a plus to me.I would definitely recommend this place! And I have a pretty high opinion of Erin too!"

1/26/18,0.41944756,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"Last year when I moved here from New York,getting adjusted to new places and trying to find my go-to spots for things was a challenge. But since the first day I walked into Studio Fifty Fifty, I was blown away. The high quality of service and attention to detail was unlike any salon I've been to. Like most, my hair and appearance mean a lot to me. As soon as I met Rio and we got started talking, I knew she was going to be my go to hair stylist. Her bubbly and energetic personality is so inviting, she truly makes you feel comfortable. I used to be very picky with how I want certain things cut or styled but every time I go see her, I just let her do her thing. She absolutely SLAYS my hair every time  She is so detailed and focused on what will look good on you and make you happy. She's honestly the best hair stylist I have ever been too and on top of that she is an amazing person with a heart of gold. I strongly encourage anyone looking for an incredible experience and hair expertise, go see Rio, she will take very good care of you"

I didn't find her on Yelp because I've been going to her for over 15 years. She listens. She gets it. She's consistently good. Thru out my punky color/style phases and  my more conservative phases. She nails them all. She is also hilarious and genuine and becomes your instant bff. I've  been there when she's seeing multiple generations of clients. They/we all consistently trust her. Cut/color.. Women's/men's/kids/unisex. She also does my brazilIan  blow out amazing too.

12/9/16,0.219989418,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"Joanna is amazing. I can't stress that enough. She takes care of her clients and has an ease that makes you feel at home. She does wonderful things with my hair, and her knowledge not only of the chemistry of colour and the techniques of colouring and cutting and styling, but her knowledge of people is absolutely fantastic. I am a client for life! But do not think she is the only fantastic human being who cares for clients here. Everyone is warm and welcoming and even the assistants have more knowledge than most hair technicians at the other salons I've been to. Everyone from the receptionist to Joanna has been hands down amazing. The salon itself is incredibly comfortable and inviting. They offer snacks and drinks (water coffee beer and wine, both red and white!) complimentary while you're being pampered and well taken care of. The facilities are impeccably maintained. Hair care is messy, trimmings, product, hair colour, it all makes a mess - but the salon is kept well cleaned. The standards are incredibly high - and it's worth every single penny. Absolutely every penny. I love Studio Fifty Fifty - and you will too. You won't regret making an appointment. And if you can't get in with Joanna, you'll still be in good hands. But seriously, ask for Joanna, she's an absolute doll!"

11/2/16,-0.14775641,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,"It's too bad you can't give no stars. Posting this on behalf of my wife. As a husband to see your wife come home a wreck because she was so sad about her haircut is a terrible thing. Now for her words not mine- Was able to get appt quickly - but was asked to reschedule an hour before arrival to the next day. The next day, was asked to come in early b.c. someone else cancelled.   when asked what i wanted - a very small trim.... trying to grow it out. was specific about no layers, no face framing etc. just a basic length 1/4 inch trim on the length. she proposed layers - i said no... and affirmatively confirmed  back no layers. seemed like we were on the same page. then she began cutting.... she cut long layers into my hair (on one side of my head only...?) and i lost the length i had been trying to grow out literally for years. my directions could not have been clearer - she simply did what SHE wanted. she caused me a huge setback and i could not be more disappointed. this stylist doesn't not listen to the client. do not trust her. Worst part is my wife texted this girl telling her how disappointed she was and the stylist never text back. Not even a ""sorry"" or anything. That's NOT 5-star service. However, clearly this salon had an all 5-star rating so YMMV"

My last stylist left for maternity leave and never came back, so it had been some time since I had trusted my hair in the hands of someone new. Kirsten B works wonders!!!! I came in with a few pictures and a single idea of what I wanted done: little to no trimming, color correction, ombré and layers. The final result- exactly what I asked for and more! The salon- beautiful! From the festive decor, to the product display, to the open stations and to top it off the luxurious interior decor and design! They even offered me snacks and beverages during my pampering and treatments... I felt like royalty :) My appt was about 1 week prior to my wedding and I couldn't have been more happy with my hair...

11/19/17,0.071405724,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"BRIDAL HAIR/MAKEUP REVIEW: I came in to do a trial for my upcoming wedding based on the positive reviews.  I have pretty unique hair in the sense that it is very long and thick, and I asked for a half-up half-down hairstyle.  I forget her name, but one of the hairstylists did my hair and makeup.  When the original idea didn't go well (because my hair was reportedly too heavy and thick to execute the style), the stylist converted my hair into a chignon, which in brutal honesty was not a very flattering style.  I had random hairs sticking out everywhere, and learned that in a few hours, the style would begin to droop anyways after doing some normal-paced walking.  The stylist told me at the start the hair would be sturdy, and then at the end she said to excuse the final product if I didn't like it because her arms got tired from working on my hair.  This sounds pretty negative, but I give props to the stylist for taking just shy of 4 hours on me and tackling that amount of hair mostly by herself.  It's a hard project, for sure, but then I would've appreciated being told they are not used to working with long hair, as opposed to being told that everything would be perfectly executed because they have done it so many times before.  For the unfounded sales pitch, I had to take a star away.  The makeup, however, was spectacularly done.  My skin looked great, and I looked like myself, but cleaned up and had my best features amplified.  I would definitely recommend this place for bridal makeup.  However, for roughly $200 to do just the makeup at my house the day of my wedding, I found it too expensive.  If I wanted both services, I was asked to pay $400.  For the steepness of the price, I had to take another star.  The staff for the most part was friendly and patient in answering my questions.  It seems however that doing haircuts, makeup, and coloring are their specialties, and so would recommend people for those services.  If you want to style long and thick hair, not so much."

I decided to go with Studio Fifty Fifty after seeing their ranking on Yelp, from the moment I called to schedule the appointment I was more than pleased with the experience. I was even running late, and when I called to tell them I would be 10 minutes late I was reassured it wasn't a problem at all! I had told the front desk when booking the appointment that I have long, thick, crazy curly hair; she recommended scheduling an appointment with Ally and IM SO HAPPY THAT I DID! Ally was incredible, she did an amazing job on my hair and I'm excited to be able to go back to her!

I boxed dyed my natural blonde hair dark red for a couple years in college. As some of my blonde sisters know, this led to the cycle of awful root touch ups and brassy ends. In January, I swore off box dye for good; determined to wait out the mismatched roots until I could no longer stand it. When that day came, I turned to a friend who gave me the recommendation that I am giving you, random yelp stranger. Sarah R. managed to lighten my over-dyed ends and work her magic on my blonde roots. All while chatting and even taking the time to explain her process to another woman in the studio. I am so excited for the next time that I get to come in, chat, sip some wine, as she hocus pocus-es my hair back to life."

RED FLAG.The Receptionist seemed lost and confused and & said Sarah R. was running late...... The Receptionist didn't even know what my appointment was for!!I walked out... Sarah called me back to apologize and said she would give me a "" great discount"". Thinking I would be provided a ""great discount"" liked she said - I drove back to the salon. When I scheduled the appointment a week prior, I mentioned I wanted  an ombre style. Sarah R. had no idea what I wanted... there is no communication in this salon whatsoever.I had to explain to Sarah R. multiple times that I wanted Ombre with blond hair and show her pictures of what I wanted - but she didn't do ombre to my hair at all!!!!! She darkened my hair and added a temporary toner. That's it.TERRIBLE service with incompetent ""stylists"" that were snobby. OH & BY THE WAY THE FRUIT WATER PROVIDED TO ME TASTED LIKE SHE SPRAYED HAIRSPRAY IN IT - SO MY BOYFRIEND HAD TO GO TO THE MEXICAN RESTAURANT NEXT DOOR TO PURCHASE A F@#%&#@! DRINK FOR ME!!!! DISGUSTING!!!!!Save your time and money and go somewhere else. It's my birthday too. Thanks for ruining my birthday & my hair Sarah R. & Studio Fifty Fifty!!! Oh & i don't think $168 for damage done to my hair included a ""great discount""!!!Petty sure all the 5 star reviews are  so fake!!!!! Would give a review WITH NO STARS if I could... ONE WEEK LATER: MY HAIR IS DARK BROWN. WHERE IS THE OMBRE WITH BLOND THAT I ASKED FOR????????OH YOU MUST HAVE USED ALL THAT BLEACH UP YOUR A$$ SARAH R. & STUDIO FIFTY FIFTY."
3/10/17,0.200873016,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"Made an appointment here for the very first time because my previous stylist had moved out of town so my hair was very grown out dirty blonde with a faded balayage. Called for an appointment and the receptionist was very helpful, asked exactly what I wanted, and was able to make an appointment for me for the very next morning with Kean. He was perfectly on time and very welcoming from the moment I arrived. I told him I wanted an auburn to blonde balayage kind of thing and a trim, showed him one photo to give him an idea, but the way my hair turned out was way better than the photo and better than I had imagined. Kean is your guy if you want bomb color, it's only been a few days but I have gotten so many compliments on it. There are no weird patches and everything blends seamlessly. I highly recommend him and I'm going to continue going back."

7/11/16,0.433761905,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"Pros:Called and got an appointment pretty quick.  Got my hair did by Ms. Katie Brunner the weekend of July 4th; the salon was buzzing with joy and Katie was just as upbeat as the salon that day! Katie did a great job with my hair, I got baby lights with a balayage. She was super nice; pleasant to talk to through the process and the end results I totally love! Nice change for the summer.Cons:Katie was great but the chic that rinsed me basically ripped my hair out while combing my hair; was ripping through tangles to the point where I asked her if she wanted me to comb myself out.  Finally I demoted her myself and told her to stop and to find me a brush so I can brush through my own hair without causing MORE damage to it. You would think that as an apprentice she would know NOT to tear through tangled hair, especially fine hair, it breaks but apparently she missed that day of class.  I can't remember her name right now but once I go back I can get that...Overall, super quick appointment making time and the actual hair process was simple and quick too.  Will be seeing Katie a lot more in the future, she's great!"

They are clean, professional, upbeat, & up-to date with the latest trends. The owner of this salon Silvanna pays attention to detail & keeps her business running top notch.

Nancy specializes in bond extensions as well as Brazilian Blowouts & color. They are located on Bolsa Chica & Heil which is close to me.

This place sets the bar for beauty standards. Anything involving hair and nails they can do. Shoot I'm pretty sure they even do perms! Which I know many locations will not do that service. Thank you 50/50! You know I will be back as it has been 4 years already! PS. You don't wanna miss Halloween or Christmas in the salon she turns it into a beautiful sight to be seen!

Now let me just say that I had just moved back from living abroad in a country that is not known for their taste in hair styling and I made the mistake of letting them dye my hair. Of course the product was not quality and my hair was a mess.Before I moved back to the States, I went backpacking and beach bumming it through Thailand and Cambodia so I had a good amount of sun damage, salt water damage and just low maintenance and hair care in general. The studio is super nice. All kinds of snacks and beverages for clients to nibble and sip on. Anyway, Dyanna did a marvelous job on my hair and brought me back to looking like I belong in civilization. She is super sweet and easy to talk to. I asked her how we could fix my hair give me something that's low maintenance. I'll let the pictures do the talking"

They called me to remind me which is good for someone who forgets things just like me! LolI showed up and the young lady at the front desk was very polite. Very bubbly and had an awesome smile! She asked if I would like a drink while she called my stylist to let him know I have arrived. She even walked me over to the coffee table to pick my flavored creamer. My stylist was Eddie! Right off the bat, he greeted me and made me feel comfortable. After showing him the styles I wanted he told me what he recommended and what he can do for me. Eddie is so AMAZING!

I have really long thick hair, and she never fails me. The ambiance is so cool, with a giant chandelier at the entry, and always some flavored water and treats at the front table. Pricing is really fair. I usually get charged more at other salons because I have more hair, which would make sense if I was getting it colored, but I don't color my hair, and here they don't charge more because I have more hair to cut. It's very nice. I am so glad I found this place and Sarah!"

I had a dark brown balayage and when a hair stylist knows how to properly balayage, you know that they're an artist. I also did a quick layered cut. Haven't been to a salon in over a year but I'll be going more often just because Katie did such a great job on my hair and it really feels like just talking and chilling with a friend. I would recommend her, but I don't want anyone else taking her time....lol but she deserves the recognition. Anyway, totally love this girl, she's hilarious and great at her job.

Anyways just my opinion, nice people though."

Not only did she do a wonderful job on my hair, she also has the most fun and amazing personality, made the whole experience that much better. Definitely going back!"

My nail came out sloppy and uneven, she acted like she wanted to get me out of there as quick as possible as well as she seemed annoyed by my presence.  I used to like the salon as I got my hair done once there but I will never be going back, I felt like I was unwanted."

2/5/15,0.274232804,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"Colleen is fantastic!!I bought a Groupon for a cut and highlights with Colleen at Studio Fifty Fifty. The days leading up to the appointment I was looking at a lot of pictures trying to figure out what I want to do with my hair. I had been growing out my natural color over the last few years so I was hesitant to make a big change. I knew I didn't want to go back to the traditional highlights.When I arrived I was greeted by Colleen and she took some time to review all my ideas. We figured out a highlight-turned-into-ombre idea, completely customized to my wishes. Colleen has a talent for listening to your ideas and translating them into an actual look. Even better, she accepted my initial Groupon so it didn't have to go to waste and was able to charge a small addition. (Very very reasonable by the way!!)My hair turned out great, the blending is absolutely perfect and Colleen gave it a nice fresh cut. Colleen also recommended toning it to make sure it is not to yellow/ bright. I looked at the mirror and liked the look so I asked if I could try it for a few days since I generally like the warmer tones. The next day however, when I was in actual daylight, I realized Colleen was completely right. It did look a bit yellow-ey. So I called her back to see if she could tone it after all. Awesome as she is, she figured out an appointment that works with my busy work schedule and invited me back.This has been the best cut, color and customer service experience I've had in a while. I highly recommend Studio Fifty Fifty, which is gorgeous, clean and modern. But more importantly I recommend making an appointment with Colleen."

I normally have gone to a hairstylist and use them for years/ a decade until I move or they move. I felt like these two ladies just didn't seem to care. The person at the front also seems judgmental. I liked Sarah more than Katie because my hair was cut better by Sarah. I was talking to Katie and a man started talking to her and she just started talking to him instead of me when I was mid-sentence and she is the one who asked me a question and I was speaking to respond to that.

I have extremely damaged and dry blonde hair that I was really scared to dye it. Right off the bat Silvanna recognized that she had to do a treat my hair with care. I came in wanting to do highlights but she told me that it would be too dramatic for what I wanted and more harmful to my hair, and she even recommended something cheaper and more healthy for my hair (is this real life?!)I haven't been this happy with my hair in years. The color is perfect, and it feels softer than ever. Silvanna was not only great with my hair, but also fun to talk to and made me really comfortable. I couldn't be more happy with the results I got today. Also at the end she recommended amazing products for me without being pushy at all, and styled my hair exactly how I wanted.

Every time I had my color done it was nothing like what I had asked for, so I branched out and took a chance on this place since it had such good reviews.I made an appointment with Katie Brunner, and not only did she get the color right the first time I showed her what I wanted, she also had a lot of good care tips for my hair including what shampoos and conditioner I could use to help the color last longer.I'm pretty awkward and shy meeting new people, and Katie made me feel perfectly comfortable. She was super sweet and easy to talk to. I found having a conversation with her came easily, where as in the past I would just sit in silence as my hair was done.

Erin gave me this ""ombré"" and in the salon, it looked nice and whatnot but when we went outside to take the picture of my hair,  it was this orange color with very brassy tones. At first I thought it was the camera phone that made it this way so I just accepted it but when I went home to show my friends they actually said it looks exactly like how it does in the picture, in person. So there it is, I spent 150$ for a poorly done ombré, and after lightening my hair, my ends were falling off and breaking (due to prior hair coloring and lightening) and she offered to give me a hair cut but I said no thanks because it was $50 or so, and so she said she'll give it to me for free, just make sure to give her a big tip lol, I thought that was funny and very bold of her.

7/27/13,0.104705215,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,"Hands down the WORST hair salon experience of my life! DO NOT GO TO CEASER! 1) Ceaser is super unprofessional and postponed my appointment twice via text. Ultimately, I was told to come in over an hour after my original appointment time. Most likely he was too hung over to work. 2) He dishonestly suggested that I dye my hair one solid color instead of getting ombre highlights with root touch up because he was double booked and basically was too busy to provide me with attentive service. Unaware of the situation at the time, I agreed to dye my hair instead...something i originally didn't want.3) He LEFT ME HANGING out at the dryer chair after he squirted dye onto my hair, while he worked on another client's extensions. DARK BROWN DYE DRIPPED DOWN ONTO MY FOREHEAD, FACE, NECK, AND EVEN CHEST. Those areas are all now STAINED. After my hair was done being processed Ceaser had me FETCH MY OWN WASHING STATION. He had to leave to go back to his other client. He never came back to get me. Fortunately, an assistant found me and washed up my hair for him. 4) He OVERCHARGES. $120 for a solid color. Really? I know this isn't Fantastic Sams, but there was absolutely NO technique with what he did. All Ceaser did was use a bottle to SQUIRT dye onto my hair. I've been charged far less elsewhere with much better service. But money really isn't the issue here. I'm willing to pay more for good results and at least decent service. Ceaser was outright rude and provided the absolutely worst salon experience I've ever had.I cannot speak for the whole establishment and debunk the hair salon due to ONE poor hair stylist, but they should really reconsider having someone like that being a part of their team. He really isn't somebody you'd want representing your company. Nonetheless, there were some kind people at Studio Fifty Fifty. One of the assistants was pleasant, friendly, and tried to repair the whole experience as much as she could. The receptionist was also kind and apologized on Ceaser's behalf. Although I appreciate her effort, I am NEVER coming back here."

She is so kind and such a fun person to just be around! My two hour consultation felt like 30 mins! Time flies when you're having fun!! Her pricing is super reasonable and she even allows you to pay with a card!! Best thing ever considering I never have cash on me!! Truly an amazing place! Great location, great vibe, and ever better stylists!!! MUST VISIT!! Ask for Katie Brunner!! She's amazing! I swear by it ! :)"

1/8/16,0.148095238,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,"This review is after 2 times, cut and dye my hair. First time, NO COMPLAINT. Everything is great. Melissa did a wonderful job. Everyone at work LOVES my hair and color. Price is a bit higher than where I used to go (more than $150 for cut and dye). However, I think it's worth the money. I left a great tip and couldn't wait to see Melissa again to compliment her work. Second time, HORRIBLE. Schedule a week ahead and I still had to wait for 30 mins (that's ok. I understand because it could b unpredictable sometime). However, I spend almost 3 hrs for my hair to cut and dye but Melissa only spend about 20 mins with me (5 mins to partially dye and 10 mins to cut). The rest of time is sitting to wait for her and my hair. I don't know how they do schedule.  My hair was dried, washed and completed dye color by another staff. The final result was UN-SATISFY. I didn't have highlight like I wanted which I told her at the beginning that I wanted to touch up color and highlight. When I asked about the highlight, she said this time is just for color and she will highlight it for next time. ( sorry Melissa, I told you what I wanted. You didn't pay attention at first, and I don't want to pay more money and take an additional time come back here again for something you can do in 1 service). The cut wasn't as good as the first time. Very rushing. I felt she was rush to finish because her other customer was waiting (I waited too). My whole neck, back and chest were covered with hair. Lots of hair. Because she forgot to cover me correctly. I ended up asking for a towel at reception while paying for service and guess what? There's so much that a staff who helped me dust off those hair even said ""it's a lot""(of hair). I felt I got ripped off when paying the money on that day. I don't completely mad at Melissa because I know she tried to do her job and she was busy. However, I think she should pay more attention to her customer. In addition, the staff who schedules appointment need to do their job better so customer want to be waiting too long and the hair-dresser has enough time in between customer."

I was hesitant about trying a new salon (being that I used to live in Ventura County and the drive is a bit long) let alone a new hairstylist but I think I have definitely found her!!

She's really in her element when working with reds and purples, but of course excels in all aspects. Doesn't matter what cut or color you want - Erin knows how to make your ideas look great on your hair. For me personally, I never know what I want, and Erin excels there too!!! I give her a basic idea and let her magic hands do the rest. I've never regretted trusting her completely - and if you have the very fortunate opportunity of working with her, neither will you.

I called her and she took care of me that morning! When I came in to the salon it was decked out with Halloween decor, sweets to enjoy and coffee / beer / wine of your choosing. Very friendly atmosphere and employees all talked to each other as friends. I explained my hair but she knew exactly what was needed without hesitation. I had two hours to get it fixed so she got right to it made me beautiful and got me out in time. Did I mention I got to vent while enjoying a beer at 10 am? Because that happened. I was a brunette trying to do my own blonde highlights and ever since that mishap I have gone back to erin and I can now say I am a beautiful blonde! My hair type: Long dark brown, TONS of hair, straight and coarse. It is a mission to deal with. She never complained and made me feel comfortable even though I knew my hair is a lot of work. (Full weave was 100 foils) I had her count. If you want to enjoy getting your hair done and get tons of compliments on your color and cut go to erin."

Andrea was good enough to ask me throughout the hair cut to make sure we were on the same page regarding style and length. The only thing that bothered me a little was that she was a bit rougher in the hair washing and blow drying, but I was fine. Also, I couldn't tell if I liked my hair  each time she asked since it was not how I would usually wear it. But Andrea was receptive to my opinions and I appreciated hers as well since she is the hair stylist. Overall, a good experience."

I dont see that the owner has reached out to any of the other bad reviewers so I'm questioning whether or not i should even do this BUT I made an appointment for Melissa yesterday (10/9/15)to get my haircut this morning(10/10/15). At about 8:30 I received a call from the salon asking me if I would mind coming in 30 minutes later than my 9am appointment.  A little put off because this isn't the first time this has happened, I say yeah sure but I'm busy and I need to have Melissa there ready to go when I get there, ""oh sure, no problem, you're her first appointment"". I show up at 9:30 and Melissa isn't even there yet. But wait...it gets better!! I waited 5 minutes and still no sign of her nor does it even look like she will be there anytime soon. So i got up and went to the receptionist and said let Melissa know I was here at 9:30 to accommodate HER schedule and that I left and will not be back! Say bye-bye to your income for today I got my cut at Salon M and Ali did a fantastic job and it was less."

The whole process felt like it took no time and is breathtaking. Exactly what I asked for. Plus, Sarah is the sweetest.

I hadn't even done standard maintenance (i.e., trimming). Although my family and friends loved my long black locks, I was tired of seeing the same thing day in and day out. I wanted a change. I wanted something different. I wanted something that wasn't drastic, but something to soften my look and bring MY SEXY BACK. It was through a referral that I booked my appointment with Dyanna. it was through yelp that I gained confidence and trust in the salon and stylists' skills. I had an idea in mind of what I wanted, and was lucky enough to have Dyanna take my VISION and turn it into REALITY. She decided to go with a very mild version of an ombre, that turned my black hair into a chocalatey/caramel sun kissed brown. She NAILED THE LOOK that I was going for!!! I am so thankful for walking into this place and will ABSOLUTELY become a regular as should you!! Ask for Dyanna, you will NOT regret it!"

I arrive a few minutes early and when the stylist comes out I inform him about my hair having trouble holding a curl and instead of recommending doing something nice with my hair he refuses to do it and proceeds to tell me how I can do my own hair!

I called in the morning on a Saturday (a scary thing for a first time) and they booked me for a few hours later with Chris Escobosa. I got there a little early and this salon is gorgeous, all of the girls are beautiful with amazing hair, and I am always happy to see male stylists, there were many! I am a stylist myself so I am crazy picky and particular. Chris introduced himself, sat me in his chair and told me of his amazing career in television hair and makeup, and his demeanor and experience made me feel comfortable! The guy won an Emmy!As experienced as Chris is, he got other stylists in the salon involved in my hair. Helping apply the bleach (it needs to go on quick to lighten my already light hair evenly) and asking for second opinions of people he knew were also great at color. He truly wanted me to get exactly what I asked for, and he did way beyond that.My hair came out a buttery, gorgeous pale blonde that was better than the photo I showed him. I am SO incredibly impressed, I will never go to another stylist. I took a chance and it was so worth it. Chris is INCREDIBLE and takes his time, he seems very busy so book with him ASAP! CHRIS IS THE MAN! And I regret not getting the receptionist and 2 stylists who helped's names, they were wonderful and made me feel so welcome. Great day for me and my boyfriend is ecstatic!"

I'm not an extremely picky person but I do have clear expectations and I do communicate my requirements in detail. The female stylist (I want to keep her name unspoken of because I'm sure she may be spectacular to others) just didn't give me the look and feel is was asking for. But that's ok, my hair can grow out in a few short weeks. No harm done :) Cool experience though."

12/27/13,0.159188988,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,"Ugh. I hate to say it because I had really liked my initial visit but second time there I got a not so good result. I was set up with a stylist, Nathaniel. Nice guy, good but not great. Claims can do it all. Color, cut extensions... Great. I needed a one stop shop. First visit he just darker a bit of light color and that was just fine.Second and full visit, was just ok. He wasn't really good at conversation but hey not all stylist are right, or maybe an off day? But I figure 2-3 or even 4 hours together it can be more pleasant. So he did my color, which I was going darker from blonde highlights ... Turns out my hair is blotchy... Spotting.. Fine. That's not the worse part. I have a full head of micro beading extensions. He missed literally half of my head. I got home and felt around and was completely surprised. Disappointed with just paying nearly $300! I just went ahead and adjusted the extensions myself just to get me thru until I see my regular hair extensionist. It was quite disappointing. I'm not the type to go back to a stylist that has already proven to perform poorly so I'll be staying away. Unfortunate for such an awesome looking salon!"

DO NOT ever go to Eddie. He is the worse hair stylist I have ever met in my life. I give one start to the receptionist because she remembered my name and she was friendly. Yesterday, after work I came for a hair cut, it was fine but not great and I paid $55 plus tip $10 (I actually expected to pay more). when I got home I found that my hair was uneven in the front. So I called this morning to make an appt to come in to get it fix. At the appt, I waited 20 minutes before they got me in. Before the fix EDDIE said this is just a simple fix and he did apologize for it, I was thinking that he could just fix it fast because I have a charity event tonight, but wrong, he made it worse, and he told me if I want it even he'd have to cut it shorter. I said if there is no other way, than just cut it. And then he told me ""No mater What I do I will not be able to  make the hair cut that you like, I will refund your money, so you can go some where else to have the hair cut you want"". What the F... is that (pardon my language)? Does he think that I came back for the refund? I just need my hair to be cut appropriately. So unprofessional, un ethical and unbelievable! I have never been in a situation like this ever in my life. And then he refund $50, I told him I paid $55, he just said "" this is all I can do, I am just being considerate"" then he look away. Really???? That $50 is not even enough to pay for my pet's grooming. As for my event tonight, I will have to tie my hair up, and I will tell everyone not to go there, worst experience ever. Well, too bad for me. I am driving to LA tomorow, back to my pervious hair stylist  for my hair cut. BE Aware everyone!"

I'd never had a facial before and it left me wondering how I've gone 23 years without one. And as for my brows, if you want PERFECT eyebrows, she can do it. Personally, I have decided that I like my brows to look a little more natural and ""wild"" I suppose.

I was celebrating my birthday at a big birthday dinner with 20+ people, and I decided to treat myself to a wash and style, so I can have beautiful curls for the birthday dinner. I called Studio Fifty Fifty and they told me they could get me in that afternoon and it would be $35.00. I decided to go for it. At first when I pulled into the parking lot I was having reservations, the salon is located right next to a dive bar, and there were two drunk guys in the parking lot talking loudly and stumbling around (I was afraid they were going to drive and might back into my car...the parking lot is small). When I went into the salon it was BEAUTIFUL!! I was very impressed by the decor! I waited about 10 minutes past my appointment time for my stylist. When she came to greet me she said ""I heard its your birthday"" I said yes, as we were walking towards the shampoo bowl. Some other stylists over heard our conversation and wished me a happy birthday. I was on cloud 9, I left so pampered and loved on my birthday. This is where it went down hill. As the stylist was shampooing my hair, she kept burping and excusing herself. Once we got back to her chair, she put a towel on my head to dry it, and then grabbed her stomach and said ""excuse me"" She was gone a good five minutes, and then returned and told me she had just gotten sick to her stomach. Of course I was concerned for her health, but I also didn't want to get sick on my birthday (I had a trip to Vegas planned that weekend). She started blow drying my hair, and kept telling me how sick she was. She had to excuse herself two more times to ""throw up""  Finally my hair was done and it looked NOTHING like the picture I gave her. I told her it wasn't what I wanted, and she told me that by the time I get to dinner my curls would ""fall"" and look more like the photo. I was livid, if someone is sitting in your chair telling you they aren't happy with the results, you fix it, you don't send them on their way and tell them it will get better. She didn't fix it (probably because she was sick) but the salon should have had someone else step in for her. I literally cried on the way home, my hair would have looked better if I just did it myself at home. I was 30 minutes late to my birthday because I was trying to flat iron and re-curl my hair myself. I will never return to this salon, please be cautious when coming here."

My boyfriend purchased a Groupon as an early Christmas gift so I made an appointment and went in for a cut, root touch-up and partial highlights with Andrea Borhegyi sometime in mid December. My previous stylist had moved back to the east coast so I was in search of a new stylist, and alas, I was definitely not disappointed! Andrea was friendly and I felt like she gave me her honest opinion when I asked for advice on color and length. I ended cutting about 4-5 inches off, which I was hesitant about at first, but ended up loving it! My  cut and style was glamorous, the root touch up matched my existing color and my highlights were great because they turned out more blond, which highlighted my face! I can't wait to go back!

That's exactly what I did. Katie is definitely an artist. You can tell by the way she works her hands and listens to you. I've seriously never had anybody cut my hair exactly how I want it and I'm very picky when it comes to my hair.

I always get great service every time, and I go in every three to four months. I get almost the same thing done each time (sometimes I vary the coloring a bit), which is highlights, lowlights, a base bump and a trim. I have very long hair so sometimes it is difficult to color, but Eddie does wonderful work every time. He always makes sure not to take too much off, as I like keeping it long, but does a great job with layering it each time. The color always turns out to what I describe exactly, which is a major reason I keep going back. I bought a Groupon once for a color and cut, and was so disappointed with what they did I went to Eddie within 2 weeks to have him fix it. (They turned me BLONDE, which is not what I asked for as I am a brunette, and my hair was slanted on the bottom from them cutting it poorly). Eddie had me fixed up and didn't charge me a full service price, which was very nice if him. I would recommend Eddie at Studio Fifty Fifty for anyone who cares about their hair and likes great service at a reasonable price."

The other day Kim cut it so it flows together and taught me the best way to dry it, and I did it myself! I didn't even use my flat iron today and I received compliments on my hair! :DTwo - Everyone is so nice! Other hair stylists that walked by while Kimberly was doing my hair stopped and complimented my hair and were just really friendly.Three - The place just looks awesome. Clean, fairly big, and well decorated."
5/12/14,0.252741121,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"This is an overdue review (sorry! got a haircut last month) is for John Laursen.  I'm always on the lookout for a new hair salon because out of all the 10 or 20 salons I've been too I never walked out genuinely happy. Luckily I discovered Studio Fifty Fifty through Groupon and can say I walked out very satisfied and look forward to coming again. The Groupon deal came with a haircut and all-over hair color but John was nice enough to give me something better. Instead I got awesome highlights that goes with my skin tone perfectly and gives me some edge! He didn't do anything too drastic, which is great because I didn't want blonde highlights or a color that made me look old. Basically he toned down my natural hair color and added the highlights. Also, he evened out my old asymmetrical haircut very well and added layers that made the highlights stand out. John was very friendly and courteous towards me. He's not like other hair stylists where they'll be silent during the cutting process, do something completely different than what you want, or suggest something and then do something else. John knew how to connect with me, it was easy to talk to him. I honestly came into the salon not really knowing what I wanted. John showed me pictures and gave descriptive suggestions for what I could do with my hair. I get so many compliments about my hair and questions on where I got my haircut. I definitely have spread the word and will be back when I need a haircut or color touch up. :)"

I saw all the great reviews on yelp so I decided to walk in since it was only a block down from my house. They set me up with Diana right away and she did an amazing job!!! :) I'm very picky about my bangs since I've had horrible cuts in the past, so I was nervous to try out a new salon. I thought I would probably need to test out a few salons in the area before i found ""the one."" But nope, this is definitely it! I'm so happy with the cut and I can tell the entire staff is very professional. Best part of it all, Diana didn't even charge me :) She said bang trims are complimentary since people need them so often! I gave her a $10 tip and I'm definitely coming back for my next cut. I'm also scheduling an appointment for some highlights because I loved Diana's wispy, caramel highlights so much!"

I've seen Andrea B at 50-50 twice now, first for full color & cut, then again for color touch up and Brazilian Blowout - and I'm just about to call & make my next appt. Andrea is fantastic, she listened and created the PERFECT coppery auburn for my hair. She's also just fun to talk to and my whole salon experience is relaxing and fun (instead of long & boring). I originally found Andrea on Groupon, saw she had good reviews, and I haven't looked back since. Pay no attention to the profile photo of my hair - that was pre-Andrea. I'll update as soon as I get my hair done again. I HIGHLY recommend Andrea. But, to be fair, I would also tell her to have more confidence in her artistry - another reviewer mentioned that Andrea kept asking her throughout the haircut if it was looking okay, and I had a similar experience. Andrea, dear, you do FABULOUS work, so you don't need to be nervous or overly concerned that your client will hate it. Love my hair every time I leave the salon and get tons of compliments. Can't wait to get back to the salon!"

8/1/13,0.371363636,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"The first time I went to this salon I went in for my usual graduated bob haircut. The salon was able to get me in the day that I called. Rob Ray was my hairdresser and he did an excellent job. The cut was so good that as it was growing out it still looked nice, which encouraged me to grow it long for the first time in forever. I went back after about 9 months and told Rob that I was going to try to keep growing it out and that he could cut my hair in anyway that he thought would look good with my very fine (as in thin) hair. I felt he had such great technique with the bob that I trusted his knowledge in what would look good for me better than myself. Rob took the time to style my hair in a way I would never have never been able to do myself. I love my new style and so do all of my friends. The salon itself is decorated nicely and yes there is a dive bar there but really people...it is Orange county so I don't think you have to worry about it  too much. If you are worried you can see your car from the salon very easily."

3/16/13,0.172949784,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"I discovered Studio 50/50 because my stylist, Greg, moved to this salon so naturally, since good stylists are hard to find, I followed. It is a great salon with a warm yet hip atmosphere. There is always good music playing at just the right volume and I get to drink wine, which instantly puts a smile on my face after a long day.Having a welcoming atmosphere is a bonus because Greg is a really great stylist and I've been going to him for 10 years!!!! In all honesty, he could probably style hair in a gutter and I would still follow. He really listens to what I want and knows me well enough to judge when I'm really ready to take a risk and change things up, or not to listen when I'm just having an ""ugly"" day and suggest he just shave my head or give me the new Miley Cyrus cut, which only she can pull off. He's been styling for a really long time, but is never stale and always stays up to date on the latest hair trends. My hair is very thick and I typically get a weave and a trim. He's great with color! I never feel like he's trying to up sell and is almost too generous with pricing because I've been going to him for so long. Go see Greg, you won't be disappointed."

She is a perfectionist who won't let you leave her chair until every hair on your head is just right. She is very attentive to your hair specifically and makes sure what she's doing is the best thing for the health of your hair. She's been coloring and cutting my hair for a year now and I have never had more compliments on my usually less than thrilling locks. She recently put in hair extensions for me that I am absolutely in love with. I finally have the hair I've always dreamed of having! To top it all off, she is the most charming gal you'll ever meet and you will surely enjoy every minute you spend in her chair. I would recommend any man, woman or child come see Dedra as she's not only great at what she does, she is just generally amazing. You will not regret trusting your hair to her!"

She'll be doing a keratin treatment on me the end of this week and I couldn't be more excited.

1/30/11,0.222397675,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"My mom has been wanting to change up her hair for a while now. She is 55 years old, and starting to experience some thinning and hair loss. She always complains that she wants more body and life in her hair! She tried Bosley, and some other hair growth products on the market, but it didn't do much. Joanna Turley has been both my mom and my hairstylist for years...when my mom expressed her hair concerns with Joanna she recommended getting extensions.  My mom immediately replied, ""Oh my gosh I am too old for extensions!!!!"" Joanna explained that yes...if she tried getting extensions down to her butt, then that may be a little inappropriate for her age, but there are sooooo many ways to use extensions to enhance one's very own hair. She told her that in her opinion, she recommends putting the extensions in, to mainly add body, and as far as the length they would only be about 2 to 3 inches longer than her hair. My mom agreed but with much hesitation. Joanna strategically placed the extensions in her hair using a new method that is not commonly seen. The appointment was quick and painless! By the time my mom was finished ( and I am not just saying this ) she literally looked 10 YEARS YOUNGER, if not more! They were absolutly beautiful. Her hair is full of body, looks super thick, shiny, strong, and more importantly NATURAL.  Anyone that does not personally know her would never be able to tell that she has extensions, and she said they are so comfortable and easy to maintain that she barely remembers she even has them in! So for anyone out there, whether you have age-related issues with your hair like my mother, or you just want some added body, length, and shine....I highly recommend JOANNA TURLEY for the job! She knows exactly what she is doing, and makes miracles happen. You can rest assured after walking out of the salon after an appointment with Joanna, you will look and feel incredible! So if you want a completely new look........Call Joanna for a new color, cut, and maybe some extra hair to enhance your look ;)"

10/8/12,0.112843137,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,I was so disappointed.  After reading all the reviews below I called to make an appointment for my 17 year old son.  He has medium length hair that has a Shawn Cassady/Parker Stevens kind of look to it.  When I called to make the appointment we were given an appointment with Michelle.   He asked Michelle to take an inch off the bottom and then clean up the sides.  Well what he got was about 2 inches off the bottom and almost no clean up on the sides.  So it looks kind of like something out of Duran Duran or Flock of seagulls.  There are also places where the cut wasn't even.   Places along the back where it is supposed to be straight and there are spots that are longer than other spots.  I also was very surprised at the $35 price tag.  He was only there for less 30 minutes and she didn't do much.  She was a very nice person and the place was clean.  Just had to stock up on a few extra hats until I can find someone to fix his haircut.....

At least thats what my stylist uses, and he is as beautiful as anything in that salon for that matter. But Im getting off point, and the point is that I get the best haircut I have ever had here by Robert. There is no denying he is a master with the shears, a regular Edward Scissorhands, and just as fast too. I was sceptical the first time, when he finished my cut in like 6 minutes, I thought crap...this is going to blow..but viola! It was perfect! My hair color is simple- I just color the grays- but its always consistent and I love the lighter color he suggested. His  assistent generally applies the color he chooses. Michelle never leaves me with a color helmut, which I totally appreciate, and I enjoy chatting with her. Robert is a consummate professional, and a bit of a diva (hey, if you were bitchen at your craft and looked like him, you would be too!). Just dont be late!!! You will not be disappointed!!!"

However there is an overflow parking lot right next door, so it's not really a problem. Inside the salon itself is beautiful.  It's a trendy atmosphere with efficient and courteous staff.  The ladies checking me in have never been anything but absolutely cheerful/ helpful and my stylist has an intermittent helper who is fabulous.  It's very clear when you walk in that the stylists are professionals. There are always refreshments up front (I love how the ice water always has fresh fruit and the food is always refreshed so that tells me that somebody is constantly and diligently maintaining the salon).  In fact, I always see the maintenance lady going through, which I appreciate because I love the clean and professional atmosphere.My stylist Bri is simply amazing. I have gone to do errands after having my hair done and seriously have been stopped by people on a regular basis so they can admire my hair.  I don't always know what I want and she's always made suggestions that I have ended up loving and is straight out honest with me when I ask her opinion. She does AMAZING cuts and has done phenomenal things with my color (I worked outside at the beach for years so she's had to do quite a bit of damage control for my color from the sun and water) and it always comes out beautiful.  I've also gone to her on a couple of occasions for her to simply blow out my hair when I have an event because she is amazing (although she doesn't do updo's).I love this new studio and would highly recommend Bri."

5/1/13,0.039884135,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,"I got a short bob cut with Melissa a while ago. the only problem I had was about 15 mins before my appointment the receptionist called to say ""Melissa is running 15 mins. late"" I worked at a salon so I understand that at times stylists can fall behind. I got there at my new scheduled time and had to wait an additional 10-15 mins only to see that my stylist was applying pink hair dye! Her assistant- super sweet girl- gave me a deep conditioning while I waited for Melissa. She proceeded to cut and style my hair with pink hair dye in her hair...I don't know. Kind of unprofessional to waste MY time because you have to dye your hair? The haircut its self was cute..I went to another stylist after because everyone was telling me on side is longer than the other. I felt like she was in a rush to take her dye out. I have been to this salon once before and I had an ombre done and it was horrible..came out orange. Anyways, I think I'm done with this salon. So hard to find good, professional hair dressers these days."

If i want just a small trim, thats what i get , no oops i cut too much! And my color is always spot on! I drive all the way  from Los Angeles to see Colleen and you should too."
12/1/11,0.324570106,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"AMAZING! I love this salon to death. I have been trying to find a good hair girl ever since my wedding back in 2007 when my original hair girl fried my hair by having me under a dryer with bleach 3 times in one week. I was always bouncing from salon to salon trying to find that one person that knew what they were doing, had a great personality, and made me feel comfortable in their chair. I bounced around about 4  salons and stylist before I went to Studio 50/50. I made an appointment with Silvanna and I couldn't have asked for a better stylist. She will give you what you want and make sure you are loving your hair before you walk out the door. If you are a little tight on money she will work with you. It was hard for me to actually put trust into someone doing my hair from the past experience, but I'm glad I did. I love knowing that when I walk in, I can sit in her chair and know that I will LOVE the outcome. I would recommend this salon & Silvanna to anyone!"

I am a person who HATES getting my hair done as there is normally something I don't like. This was the BEST experience of my life! He was sooooo great! Everyone around him in the salon was great too including his assistant Cameron. Love them. And he is hot. Done and done. Ill forever drive from LA just to see Ceaser!

I live near the salon so I looked up the reviews on Yelp, and called to make an appointment.  Since I'm blonde I asked the receptionist if there was someone she recommended...when I arrived for my appointment, they told me the girl I was originally scheduled with had to leave early but Chris was available....I was a little nervous, not going to lie.  So I met with Chris and explained to him what I wanted done, he took the time to ask questions and gave me feedback on what he thought would work.  He definitely knows what he's doing!  I LOVE my hair color, and the cut...he did a great job with the highlights, and I've received many compliments on both the cut and color since going to him...I will definitely be going back to see Chris."
7/13/12,0.343399235,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,Studio Fifty Fifty really made me feel comfortable & welcome when I walked in with out an appointment made. And the best part of it all was Chris Escobosa! He was amazing and not only did I need a cut and style but my daughter needed a cut and style! Chris took the time to ask questions of likes and dislikes and then went right to his amazing work. I love my cut and he took the time to even show me a few tricks to make a better style for myself. I feel younger & better than ever. I have had many compliments on his work done & I have left my other hair (fairy) as I like to call her to just see CHRIS! My daughter is a Teen & loves him. She now wont let anyone else touch her hair! If your looking for just the right touch and a classy place to get your hair or makeup done go see Chris! I did my research & Chris has many famous stars he has done his magic on. My favorite show he has made his impression on is the hit TV series Criminal Minds. His make up work is also off the charts! With that all being said stop by & Chris would be more than happy to listen & work his magic on your hair or makeup! Thanks Chris you ROCK!

Right away I was happy because they have their own parking lot with ample space, parking can be such a nightmare sometimes so I always appreciate that! The receptionist was friendly and the atmosphere was lively and nice, the salon was really bright and open, it felt nice on a sunny afternoon. Roxanne was prompt and had exceptional customer service. She led me into a private room with relaxing music playing. It was comfortable and the bed was even tempurpedic! I would come here just for a nap on that thing! This was my first facial ever and the experience was so wonderful, I'm now a believer and definitely hooked, I cant wait to go back! The oils she uses smelled amazing and an incredibly relaxing shoulder massage was included! Two days later and I'm really noticing how incredible my skin looks! Where did my pores go?!? And seriously not a single black head in sight, I honestly cant remember when my skin looked so great! I don't know how often I'll need to go back, but I'm certainly going to make the time and set aside the money to go see Roxanne even though I live in 30 miles north, definitely worth it!"
