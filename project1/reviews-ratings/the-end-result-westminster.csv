It's a one man show at The End Result, quick, quality service. Definitely would recommend setting your next hair cut appointment  up with joe. #supportsmallbusinesses"
9/3/16,0.18047619,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Joe is really good at what he does and is very easy to get along with. He has a ton of clients, and since he is a one man shop, can only take clients by appointments, so just give him a call. Would highly recommend him! Shop definitely has an old vintage charm about it. My parents have lived in the area for 30+ years and still remember the barber shop being there in the late 70s."

It's not because he's a dick or a snob, it's so the customer gets the best experience possible. So call. Set it up. If not, Supercuts is ready to hack your head. He's on time.  You better be as well."

I just think that's really neat.Not to mention my husband can walk to his place. And I must say he always looks good after leaving! Joe is a great guy and can get super busy so get those appointments in! Thankfully we have never had a problem:) It's great to be able to support a local business
8/5/14,-0.019047619,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,This guy is rude. I was standing in the door asking my 2 year old if he wanted a hair cut here and the guy sitting in the chair doing absolutely nothing tells me he won't cut his hair because he only takes appointments. Seriously your doing nothing. His hair takes 5 mind and you just let a customer walk away and lost money.. I will be sure to tell lots of people how rude this place is..

Driving by, I wouldn't have known it was there and its not the typical place you'd find a salon. I had my hair done by Stephanie and am so excited to have such a great new stylist!"
