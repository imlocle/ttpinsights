It's a tiny little shop with two chairs located inside a hotel.Dean gave me one of the best haircuts I've ever had. He is incredibly interesting and fun to talk to. Will definitely come back next time I'm in LA."

I went to the location in the Fairmont Miramar Hotel, and hady haircut my Lloyd (the owner who it's named after). Absolutely fantastic experience! He listened to exactly what I wanted and gave me one of the best haircuts I've ever had. Awesome little shop too, and a very reasonable price. I'll definitely be back anytime I'm in the area!!"

I always take the suggestion from a barber to how my hair would look best and they nailed it. They have a couple locations which is cool, and Lloyd the owner is a very cool guy. I'll see you guys in a couple weeks for another cut!"

4/29/17,0.471978022,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've had a fade for 6 years, and I have my ""places"" all across the city. LA has great b shops.  I like going to lots of different shops and I rarely have one shop I stick to.However, Im officially anchored to Lloyds.  The reason isn't the shop (although the vibe is great) it's the barber: Julissa is easily the best barber in the city right now. She's very particular and detail oriented.  And, like a real artist, never fully pleased with her own work, even after the cut (I said ""perfect"" , she said ""close"")Only reason I wasn't going to write this review is that I don't want her schedule to blow up! But take the rec and go see her."
4/10/17,0.080486111,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This review is for Omar, who worked on Mondays only. I've always wanted more guidance from a Barber but I've found many gun shy and only willing to do what you basically already have.Omar is ready to help. Omar will ask you about who you are, what you've down in the past and what you like. He will then suggest different styles that will work for you. This has been a big help for me.Omar cares about his craft. He takes his time to ensure you're getting a high quality cut. He's a solid conversationalist as well which makes the time go by quickly.The Barbershop is a small shop in the Hotel. It has comfortable chairs, booze, and they do all of their payments with a tablet which makes it easy."
5/12/17,0.029761905,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"The Fairmont location has a bad ass, old fashion style to it. It's low key, and easy going to go there, unlike most of the other barbershops in LA which are busy.Setup an appt online w/ Dean. he's the man"
3/14/17,0.1146,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,"At first I was apprehensive of going here because I have mixed curly hair and I often times  people who don't know how to work with my hair. Even black barbers tend to fuck my shit up. But after seeing a number of men of various backgrounds walk out of here with good haircuts, I thought I'd give it a shot.  The job they did on me (I think my Barber's name was Manuel?) was great! One of the best haircuts I've had in a long time. Very satisfied with my experience. I would totally come back here if I was on the Westside more often.  I can't give this place a full 5-stars though, because a few years before my haircut, I had a shave here that was done very bad. I have curly hair on my face and the barber was going against the grain of my growth pattern, which is a big no-no for my hair type. The whole experience was unpleasant and my skin was extremely irritated for the rest of the day. Ended up with a bunch of ingrown hairs that I had to pick out myself before shaving again. However, on the day I went, it was some older gentlemen filling in for Lloyd, so I might be willing to give them another chance when the regular staff is there. But still, its $50 that I paid for a shave I would have been better off without.   5/5 for the haircut1/5 for the shave  +1 for the service quality"
1/13/18,0.411447811,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I lived in Venice for a year and became a regular customer while I was here. Lloyd is truly a master at his craft: not only does he give exceptional haircuts, but he also knows how to listen and make suggestions. I changed my hairstyle quite a bit, and Lloyd's judgment in giving me a new cut was flawless. At my most recent haircut, when he asked me how I wanted a couple of details, I was really comfortable saying, ""whatever you think looks best."""
9/16/17,0.173333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Dean is the man! Extremely professional and delivers a high quality cut for a very reasonable price.
8/13/17,0.427380952,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Just want to say wow! Had a great first time experience in Lloyds barbershop yesterday. A super friendly environment just really amazing customer service. Want to give a HUGE shout out to Mr. Dean one of the best barbers I ever met in the whole LA county area. He does an amazing job and will make you laugh while doing it. For sure if anybody is around Santa Monica area make sure to check Lloyds out the shop is inside the Fairmont Hotel. Once you get a haircut by dean trust me you would become a regular before you even know it!
10/24/16,0.30375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Lloyd is great. Been coming here since he opened for business. His haircuts and shaves are great. He also has a great personality and very accommodating to his customers. I highly recommend going to Lloyd as you wont be disappointed!
11/27/16,0.00625,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"Very expensive and bad quality!I bet these reviews are done by friends and families, i found this place via Yelp and got fooled by good reviews,This place is inside a hotel and I went there yesterday for a haircut and ended up with going somewhere else to fix it even though I paid 45$ ! Also I parked my car inside I thought it will be free after validation but keep in mind you have to pay 6$ !"
9/19/16,0.568888889,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Brandon did a fantastic job! He took his time and made sure it was perfect. He did take a before picture since my hair was down to my chin all the way around. However he didn't take the after picture so I will post the after picture on here for you Brandon. Thank you again for an excellent experience!!

2/22/17,-0.325,Negative,1,2.0 star rating,2,"I had a relaxing shave with Dean on Saturday. Unfortunately, it was of poor quality. I returned to my hotel room to find that my shave was uneven and that he had even missed a few patches altogether. Yikes, not acceptable for a $55 shave."
3/23/17,0.331944444,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Consistency is key when it comes to barbershops.  Dean and the rest of the Lloyds team has done a great job on my hair for the past year and I always leave with a clean cut and in a good mood.  The team is friendly and you can't beat the location inside the Fairmont.
3/18/17,0.216477273,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,First time coming and man did Dean take care of me.  I was a little nervous about the price point but that all disappeared when I saw my haircut.  You pay for what you get and here they give you a top notch haircut and the service is amazing.  I found my new barbershop and I will not hesitate to come back.
4/17/16,0.345833333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Dean completely transformed me from scruffy cave man into looking pretty damn sharp.Thanks mate! Top marks!

2/23/16,0.028869048,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"I'll be nice and give this spot 2 stars. Don't get me too wrong, because I dug the decor. It has an old, classic style vibe and I also like how it's hidden inside the Fairmont, thought that was kind of cool. Rarely do I negatively criticize on Yelp, but my overall experience was rather annoying. I've definitely been to a much better barber in the neighborhood for a better price and a better cut. I have no idea why or how this barber shop has two dollar signs?! Don't believe the hype, it's not worth $45. A cut here is more than double the price than the local barbers. All I got was a fade, a $45 fade. For a regular dude, this is more like a three to four dollar sign shop. If money doesn't matter to you (all you ballers out there), then I can see how it's two dollar signs. Maybe they raised the prices recently but $45 for a regular cut, no thanks. I mean, the barber was nice, and he didn't do a terrible job (except for the semi razor cut on one of my ears) but nothing else was added to or even offered. No shoe shine or hair wash or drink or hair product. Not that I wanted any of those but one would think something else be included for a $45 fade.  My last beef though, would have to be with the barber who told me it was $25 over the phone. First, the guy's voice on the phone was hard to understand and sounded like he just woke up, very congested or sick. I call to ask how much cuts were and it sounded like he said $25 as I repeated ,""$25?"" He said, ""yeah."" Thus, knowing that it was $45, I wouldn't have even wasted my time coming. Furthermore, I was bamboozled and that's not cool."
9/21/15,0.28,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I was just in LA for the weekend and Brandon was able to see me on the same day.  Thanks Brandon, the cut was good enough for the ladies.  Tip: dont call for a reservation,  reserve online."
6/23/16,0.130555556,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"This place is definitely a $$$$ barbershop. Yelp has it listed as $$ but after my cut and shave, I was billed $75! ($45 for the cut, $30 for the shave). I don't mind paying the extra money if I knew going into it, however the price indicator on yelp was misleading. Regarding the cut itself, I felt like Anthony was very rushed to get me out. He didn't offer to wash my hair (I had to ask). He didn't offer to blow dry or put product in my hair (I literally had to ask after I got out of the chair). He's a nice guy, but for the money, I expect the bare minimum of what you get offered everywhere else."
11/9/16,0.7125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Lloyd is the best barber I've ever had. I consistently get a great haircut every time. He has great attention to detail and is a pleasure to talk to. Bottom line: Get your haircut here. You won't regret it.
2/28/17,0.375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Dean is a great barber and has made me a regular customer.  Very consistent and pays attention to the details.
4/27/16,0.143402778,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Great place to stop by for a fresh up. They open at 6am and the customer service is amazing. Both barbers are helpful hip and sophisticated all at the same time. Give them a shot and see what I mean from black white Asian Mexican Middle Eastern Ect...... They can do it the way it is suppose to be done.
4/5/17,0.521,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,These guys are the best. The service is amazing and I feel like the staff is family at this point. I found out about lloyds through their website went there and haven't gotten a haircut with anyone else. They are all very professional as well and Dean really knows what he's doing! Love this shop and guarantee you will as well!
3/17/17,0.133333333,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,I had a 22 year old girl who didn't know how to cut hair very well. I showed her a photo of the haircut I'd like and she completely screwed it up. Over cut my hair by 4 or 5 inches. I ended up going home and shaving my head because I was worried she couldn't even handle a buzz cut.
3/30/17,0.3925,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I've gone here a handful of times. Dean always comes through with the high skin fades. If you go here make sure to book an appointment with Dean!
5/19/16,0.367083333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been going to Lloyd for 5 years and always received a great cut and he is ALWAYS on schedule. If you like a real mans barbershop that has style and want a great conversation and vibe, this is place. Lloyd is a fantastic, hard working guy who truly cares about his work and for his clients. I'd never go anywhere else!"
4/23/16,0.566666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,One of the best haircuts Ive ever got. Very relaxing set up and great service. He spent a good hour on my hair and it looked great.
2/22/17,0.516,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Very classy place. Been going to Dean for 8 months and get a good cut / beard trim every time. Most consistent haircuts I've ever had. Keep up the great work!
3/26/15,0.475,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Awesome barbershop. I just dropped inn for trimming my beard after reading other Yelpers reviews. You were not wrong. The sense of professionalism i greeting you as you walk in.  The result was perfect. Go here for your beard and haircut. Highly recomended!!
9/25/15,0.229012346,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Llyods barbershop ended my search for where I will exclusively be getting my beard and hair cuts. Anthony killed it with styling my beard. If you want a classic master barber experience with attention to detail, class and good conversation look no further. As a bonus it's hot as F**k today so I got a nice menthol spritz and cool blow dryer to cool me down. Winner. Do it."
1/18/16,0.396,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Meaghan did a very detailed job and gave me one of the best tapers I've ever had. The commitment to her trade is admirable and I would highly recommend her to others. If you care about how you look it's well worth the price. Overall, A+."
12/22/16,0.396166667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Went for first time. Very pleased and my wife approves.  Easy to use website to set up appointment. Very friendly people. I highly recommend this shop
9/5/15,0.109907407,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,Well the expectations was high after the comments here and it was my first clean shave. I had a fullbeard and wanted a clean shave pretty easy task i would say. I had a good experiens while i was there no complains they where nice and friendly and the shave felt good. Only the 55$ were a bit expensive. When i checkt the shave back home it wasn't very clean and i still had blemishes and he let the sides unshaven what wouldnt be so bad but they weren't even the same lenght :( so i needet to reshave at home :(
2/8/16,0.354279811,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I cannot remember a better haircut I've ever received. Although a bit pricey, you definitely get what you pay for at Lloyd's. A lot of people may recommend Floyd's, but trust me, I've been to both and have to say that Lloyd's is just on another level.If you are to go here, be sure to ask for Anthony if you're a new comer, he'll definitely set you up right. All the workers are professional and friendly, so even if it's not Anthony, I trust that you'll be in good hands.However, be sure to wear a suit or else you will feel out of place in this swanky joint - do not come in with a t-shirt and jeans (lol)."
2/20/15,0.23043956,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Best barbershop in LA. I know this sounds like hyperbole but I'm dead serious. I've been to more than 10 different barbershops and stylists in LA to find the right cut including: blind barber, bolt, floyds, even the barber shop club.Lloyds tops them all. I won't let anyone else touch my hair. Brought in a photo first time and got that exact cut and have been going there for almost a year now. I highly, highly recommend booking Lloyd or Anthony. These guys are consummate professionals. One less thing to worry about because I always get a great haircut there."
11/9/16,0.350333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Anthony was exceptional. I got a great haircut in a short amount of time.  Classy joint! Highly recommend
12/28/15,0.438148148,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Was visiting Santa Monica and needed a haircut - found this place online and was actually able to book an appointment online - the space is cool and the barbers all super nice - Brandon was my barber. The haircut and shave was the best I've ever had. I don't have anything elaborate done when I get my hair cut but the time and detail that Brandon did was beyond anything. Very relaxed atmosphere and I would highly recommend this place to everyone - well worth the price and convenience (you can book online instead of taking a chance by just walking in)
8/3/14,0.513541667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Quick trip to LA, staying in the Fairmont. I needed a haircut and called Lloyd's for an appointment. They're located in the lobby of the hotel, but have a great regular clientele, from what I gather. Anthony was the barber, and the cut he gave me is outstanding! The best I've had since 1993, from an old barber in Assisi Italy. And Anthony is a great conversationalist to boot. I'm kinda thinking I might have to find a reason to get out to LA, and Lloyd's monthly! Thanks Anthony!"
2/4/16,0.6375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Lloyd and Anthony are the best!!  I've been going here for over a year now and they consistently give a great cut each and every time.   I would recommend to anyone looking for a top quality barber shop.
10/28/16,0.164351852,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Best haircut I've ever had in my life. I was fortunate enough to have Dean as my barber. He was incredibly professional and knew exactly what I wanted after showing him a picture of the hair style I was aiming for. Super quick cut (I was a walk in though, I'd recommend getting an appointment here) but boy I couldn't be happier with the result. I'll be seeing these guys regularly from now on. 10/10 would recommend, you won't be disappointed!"
1/19/16,0.277430556,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Lloyd's Barber shop is an great space that mixes that classic vibe with a great cut.  It has become my go to and I dont see that changing. The price is a little higher than some places but the service, ambience, conversation and attention to detail, along with knowing your going to come out looking your best, is more than worth and extra 5 or 10 dollars. Anthony, Brandon and Lloyd are doing a great job here and no matter who ends up cutting your hair you cant go wrong."
11/14/14,0.195519481,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Loved the service at this tiny yet very cozy and accommodating barber shop. Location is definitely an asset; a great get-together spot at either the Fairmont Hotel restaurant/bar or at the Bungalow right after you service your hairstyle back into existence. Definitely a very dapper, manly spot - don't mind bringing in some ""Books"" to ""read"". Stay classy!

10/7/15,0.341964286,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Yeah I'm jumping on this 5-star bandwagon because they're worth every cent.  If they can make me look good, believe me they can do the same for you.  Brandon is a cool cat and his attention to detail is top shelf.  Nice space right there in the Fairmont too, with a chill leather recliner and some spirits on standby.  Well done, fellers.  See you next month."

I had a cut and a beard trim, Anthony (sorry if I got the name wrong) was very intuitive in getting an idea of what I wanted and balanced my beard trip and my high fade to look balanced.He worked fast.I also bought a tub of hair product.Only negative was the high price point but the price matched the experience!"
1/11/16,0.157777778,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Today I got my haircut my Anthony, and I had a really pleasant experience. My hair grows out quickly, so I find myself going to the barbers or a salon quite frequently. But recently, I haven't had luck with my haircuts. All my stylist moved out of state, so I've been searching for a good person who knows what they are doing. Initially, the pricing seemed a little steep for a cut but after carefully reading through reviews and looking through the photos, I felt pretty comfortable letting one of barbers here do their thing.I wasn't disappointed with Anthony. What initially began as a Caesar cut turned into a nice fade after learning how to distinguish these cuts lol. It turned out to be a really smooth, sharp and simple haircut. I felt like Anthony knew that simple doesn't mean sloppy or easy. Don't underestimate a simple cut! Just exactly what I was hoping for. And the best part was that I didn't have to go home and fix it up a little bit. He read my mind and took care of all those nuances that arise from Asian hair.Very satisfied with the ambience, service and my experience. A little steep on the price, but it's quality for sure compared to all those rip off places around weho. Definitely will stop by again to see Anthony in a couple months. Recommended."

Anthony was the barber who took care of me.  He was really nice, laid back, & had great attention to detail.  I also liked how he offered suggestions for my cut specifics.Overall great experience & have already scheduled my next cut."
7/7/14,0.239419192,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Been to Lloyd twice now.He offers a very clean haircut for professionals and anyone else alike. He is very responsive to his clients requests while keeping in mind good techniques that permit a great style and look. As with any new barber, it will take a few trips for him to learn your style and look. Highly recommend and he is a great person to chat with for the 30min you are there!Only complaint is I wish a wash was included in the price of a regular cut to help get all the extra hairs out!"
3/2/14,0.188461538,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I went to Lloyd's regularly when I lived in Santa Monica, and try to make it back when possible. Lloyd is friendly, timely, and professional, and the jazz in the background is a nice touch.Yes, you will pay more than at a regular barbershop ($40 for a men's cut), but the quality is top notch. He's also significantly cheaper than the absurd prices salons in the area charge to cut men's hair.As another reviewer mentioned, parking in the area can occasionally be a pain, but I can't remember ever having to park more than a couple blocks away in a meter spot."
4/12/15,0.429166667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This is the best Barbor shop I have been to in Santa Monica. After a few attempts at other places I found this place on yelp and haven't gone anywhere else since. Brandon & Anthony are just great guys, who have great skills and are fun to be around."
7/25/16,0.230613426,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"As a frequent global traveler, I have had my haircut in at least 20 different countries and probably half of the states in the USA, so when I say that the cut I received from Lloyd was one of the best, I am basing it on a lot of grooming experiences and I really mean it!  Lloyd's cut was EXACTLY the way I asked, and he even managed to fix the butchering job I did while using my razor to trim the hair on the back of my neck. It's also the type of cut that stays looking sharp and fresh for some time. I have read some complaints here about prices. Sure, anyone can find a local barber shop for a quick, cheap cut, but if you're looking for top-notch men's groomers who will give you a cut/style/ shave/etc. that rivals any high-end men's grooming options out there, $45 for a cut is a GREAT value! Without a doubt, Lloyd and his associates (along with Momo at Watanbe in Harajuku, Tokyo) has become my go-to for my grooming needs. Thanks Lloyd!"
10/21/13,0.201328321,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I recently started going to LLoyd's Barbershop, located in the Fairmont, after I heard that Anthony, (previously cut at Floyd's in Venice and The Blind Barber), was now working here.   Anthony is an amazing barber who always gives a consistent, perfect cut and is an awesome guy to chat with while you're in the chair. The Barbershop itself is very nice, a quiet room with just a single chair (for now) so you can get your hair cut in peace.   The prices are a bit more then I normally pay for a cut; but it does include a glass of liquor which is nice.      The only real downside is having to park in the area, but the last few times I got lucky with a spot in front.  Valet from the hotel is very expensive."
3/4/14,0.281121212,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Wow. Lloyd is the most skillful and amazing barber/stylist I've ever had. Lloyd has the ability not only to do straight-razor shaves and shape-ups but also scissor-cut new styles like pompadours, slick-backs, any quiff you could think of.He's extremely precise in his work and recommends any adaptations to your current hair-style to help match/blend the shape of your head.I recently moved to LA and was worried about finding a good barber who could scissor cut a real hairstyle and not charge $100+/haircut. I stumbled upon Lloyd's through yelp reviews and decided to give him a shot. His prices are very reasonable and he's an extremely affable and genuine person.I've found my barber for life (or, as long as I live in the LA area).Cheers!"

Only reason for only 4 stars is their prices are pretty high for what you get, after adding tip and valet which is not complimentary it makes it a pretty penny for a trim. Still a very good place and friendly people."

7/3/15,0.116666667,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"Poor service, long wait time, and offensive language is how I describe my experience at Lloyds Barbershop. I was working late and wanted to swing by to get a hair cut before a holiday weekend. I called in around 10am to someone who was very short on the phone he said if I wanted to schedule a reservation I needed to go to their webpage to book a time. I thought what a clever idea why don't more shops offer this. I decided even with the lack luster stylist that answered the phone I would give it a try. I booked a 7:30 apt online. The process seemed smooth until I went in. I arrived at 7:15 to a barber who was working with a client. He welcomed me with a drink and said if I go to the bar I can get a glass there cause he ran out. I said no I'm not interested but thank you. He continued to cut his clients hair. I was waiting as I over heard the barber talk about personal things with his client until the conversation started to become super unprofessional. I ended up waiting over 25 minutes and had to leave to go to a meeting. The barber ran out after and offered me a free hair cut and said he apologized but the other barber over booked him. I declined and told him I appreciated but but I had a reservation at 7:30 not 8 and at 45.00 a basic hair cut I expected better service and a professional environment. Who ever the manager is I hope you rethink this type of environment for the type of clientele your looking to attract."

Lloyd's was heavily recommended to me so I called for an appointment expecting a booked schedule, but there were openings the same day! I booked an afternoon appointment and came by. The shop itself is cozy and has a great decor to it; it's small so your experience will always be very personal. Lisa was extremely pleasant and friendly when I came in and offered a choice of beverage (definitely helps to be over 21, that's all I'm gonna say) while I waited in the big comfortable armchair for my appointment with Anthony to start. Anthony was also extremely friendly, personable and he did a wonderful job. He took great care and had pride in his work which really shows in the haircut I'm sporting now. It was great to see a place where everyone, including the customers were happy. I will be back again, that's absolutely certain - you could go so far to say that I'll be traveling from Chicago to get my haircut at Lloyd's in Santa Monica every few months. Thanks Anthony, Lisa and Lloyd for a great experience today, my only regret is I cannot give you 6/5 stars."

Showed up and I knew this place was classy. Clean, quiet, and professional - the guy in front of me walked out with a slick haircut, clean shave, and a smile.

What I like most about going to Lloyd is how good my hair looks after every single visit. And he remembers exactly how I like it so I never have to tell him when I go in. How Lloyd goes the extra mile to get to know his customers on a professional as well as personal level is the other thing I like about him. I always enjoy getting a cut from Lloyd."

I am picky just like everyone else and couldn't seem to find the right fit. Fortunately, a friend of mine recommended me to Lloyd's Barber Shop, which just so happens to be down the street from my house. On top of that, I was told to go see a guy named Anthony. Anthony is as personable as they come and knows how to cut hair. It felt like I was kicking back with an old friend. Needless to say, I am no longer searching for the right barber/stylist. Anthony from Lloyds has earned my business as a repeat customer."

I was traveling with a notoriously poorly groomed friend and decided to make an appointment and force him to get a haircut. The ambush worked and my friend never looked better! Lloyd did a great job and made the experience comfortable and positive for my reluctant friend and the price was totally fair for the expert skill and great taste that Lloyd commands. I remembered the positive experience and when I was in town again this week, scheduled an appointment for a cut for myself. Lloyd was just as awesome again this time and even remembered when we came in before! He remembered where we were from and what we were all like and even what we did for a living! It's remarkable because it just shows that the guy cares about what you say to him on a personal level as much as he cares about the work that he does! As far as the work that he does: he knows his craft! I didn't need to tell him much and he gave me exactly what I wanted! It was like he just knew what kind of haircut I needed that I wasn't getting from my normal barber back east. And I would also like to add that I think the price was the same as it was two years ago and it's a price I feel very comfortable paying for such a great haircut. I knew it would be good based off past experience here, but I'm still surprised at how awesome my whole experience at Lloyd's was! I can't recommend this guy enough!"

I told Anthony that I didn't want much cut off, just to even it out and clean up the edges. Next thing I know he's telling me if he cuts any more my hair will stick straight up. I went from having a side part to having basically a flat top. If you're looking for a $50 cut that'll last you for a few months when you just wanted a bit trimmed off, this is your shop. Also - it's not even -- I've got some crazy jagged edges in the front. Who knows how that happened."

Lloyd has been cutting hair and studying the art of being a barber for over 13 years. He's a master. I searched LA for 1.5 years trying to find an affordable haircut from someone that was going to understand what I wanted and get it right consistently. Lloyd does that while maintaining easy-going conversation and an old school barbershop experience. I wouldn't call my hairstyle elaborate but there are certain things that I need to have done or I go crazy, and he always remembers each of them. Whether you're coming from out of town or looking for someone consistent I'd definitely recommend trying Lloyd out. Call for an appointment instead of emailing and use the meter parking on Ocean unless you're a guest of the hotel.And yes, I'm not the reviewing type but joined Yelp so I could give Lloyd the props he deserves."

The barbershop looked both warm and inviting in that old-school barbershop way, a place you wouldn't mind hanging out for awhile if you had to wait for your haircut.Anyhow, I took a card and made an appointment for last Wednesday. When I arrived the proprietor Lloyd was ready to go, but first offered me a bottle of water as I had hurriedly biked to the shop after finishing work.Lloyd gave me a fantastic haircut. My wife noticed it immediately and said he's better than the guy in NYC who cuts my hair. His prices are very reasonable as well. I'll definitely visit Lloyd's shop in the future when I am in LA - and next time I'll treat myself to a straight razor shave!"

Lloyd is extremely friendly and a talented barber. He really listens to what you're looking for in a haircut. One recommendation is be sure you call ahead and make an appointment. Like I said I couldn't be happier and this is going to be the only place I get my haircut.
