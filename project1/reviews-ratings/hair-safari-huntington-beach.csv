8/27/17,0.082817183,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"My husband is really picky about his hair cuts, he started going to Hair Safari and he really is happy with the hair cut Lori gives him so he told me to get a hair cut from her since I am not happy with the hair cuts I got with various beauty salons(cheap to really expensive hair cuts). I hesitated at first "" Me"" going to a barber to get a hair cut???? But I said I will give Lori a try, nothing to loose but my hair.  I went there, Lori gave me a hair cut, WOW I really like the hair cut.  I went back and got a hair cut again from her, this time was even better.  I finally found a hair stylist, as long as I live in this area, I will go to her."

I had my hair cut from long to a choppy bob, and lemme just say it was by far the most beautiful job done! It was my first time coming here and once you sit in that chair, it's so relaxing. Her styling is so well done and precise. Lori is such a nice, easy-going person and will give you an amazing cut! Beautiful work and will for sure be coming back! THANK YOU!"

1/8/15,0.315151515,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"Let me start by saying...Wow! I went into Hair Safari after getting what I thought was the perfect pixie cut for my 40th birthday. I was in San Francisco for the weekend and did my best Yelp research for a salon to 'do the deed'. Midlife crises? Maybe, but I digress. After I got home and worked with the cut on my own, I quickly found flaws that would prevent me from having a 'wash and go' style (sides were too long and top hair was heavy). Anyways, while in the HB area, my husband recommended I stop by the shop to see if Lori (his usual barber) was available for a quick fix to my 'wannabe' pixie. I was super hesitant to see a barber, because well, let's face it, people typically associate barbers with men-only cuts, but I thought to myself, um I do have a man-like cut, so what the heck, lets roll with this crazy idea. Sooooo glad I did. That girl has some skills! I pulled up the same Pinterest pics I had shown the first stylist and Lori was able to see where the issues were immediately. She went to work like Edward Scissorhands and before I knew it, my pixie was cute again! Thanks Lori and crew for providing not only the perfect cut, but also a comfortable environment. You've made a customer for life!"

My kids loved their hair cuts and so did I! They really liked that the ladies were so nice! I was thrilled that I did not have to wait and was not kept there too long! These ladies made us feel so special!! Great place to get the entire family a hair cut! I will most definitely be a regular at hair Safari!!

And it never matters who the barber is, Hair Safari only seems to hire top notch professionals, that are always happy to see you and know how to cut hair. Thanks for always making time for me, and the best haircut in town!"

Both my boys got their haircuts there when they were kids.  You won't find another barbershop that is better!  Men, women, young and old, everyone comes out looking good."

4/2/14,0.131818182,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"Hair Safari has been my barbershop of choice for close to 23 years. I have never walked away disappointed which, to me, reflects dedicated good work and customer service. Lori has been far and away the most indispensable professional in my grooming needs. You get top notch service for bargain prices. I have experimented at salons for random events but would trust no one else for my wedding day. I live in Orange and still drive the 45 minutes because of the results."
8/11/14,0.34375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,Just got my first fresh cut there and it's lookin pretty damn slick. Very experienced barbers who know what they're doing as long as you know what kind of cut you want. Just tell them and they'll whip it up like pie. Very satisfied.

4/27/14,0.533333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,Lori at Hair Safari is great! I'm picky when it comes to getting my bangs trimmed and she is awesome.  Always checking to make sure I am happy with the length before cutting any more.  Conveniently located with lots of parking.
5/2/14,0.338888889,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"I found this place while meeting a friend for dinner in Huntington Beach one night and noticed the super bright barber pole (see picture). Checked out the reviews and came back the next day to let one of their expert barbers cut my hair. Since then, I've been back 3 times and each time, their barbers do a perfect job. Hair Safari is now my go-to barber shop."
5/14/14,0.136458333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"Hair Safari is mainly a men's barber shop but they do women's hair, too. My husband and I both get our hair cut here. The thing that makes this place so much better than the other barber shops around is the skill level of their barbers and the quality of their haircuts. They take the time to listen to what you want and have the experience to pull it off. Their prices are the best for the service you get and there's never really a wait since they usually have at least 3 barbers ready to go."

6/24/14,-0.055,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,"I have been going to hair safari for about eight years, unfortunately I moved away a couple years ago. I still cannot find a consistent barber that can cut my hair the way Lori cuts it. I still am in Cali often and work Mr haircuts into my travel to Cali and always get my hair cut while in town. Totally professional and friendly staff with tons of experience....go see them you won't be sorry"

7/12/14,0.345833333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"My boyfriend and I have been getting our haircuts here for the last few months and we're both really happy with the results. All the barbers here are true professionals and they get every detail perfect, every time. They really make an effort to make you look your best and they do it at great prices.  You don't even need an appointment here and the wait is never that long since they have several barbers there at any given time. Definitely our go-to place for haircuts. We cannot wait till our son can get his first haircut there."
8/5/14,0.313265306,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"Saw all the great reviews and with it being so hot lately, I decided to stop by and get a haircut from these barbers. Glad I did. These barbers know what they're doing (at least the one that cut my hair). Not only did she take the time to really understand what exactly I wanted, she stopped every step of the way to make sure she was still on the right track. I appreciated that extra care and my hair looked perfect as a result of it. Great job!"
7/15/14,0.407222222,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"I usually never write reviews on yelp, but this time I just had to because I was truly impressed with the quality haircuts they give. I would highly recommend anyone to come here, because the ladies where very nice, and made me feel really comfortable. It's affordable, professional and amazing. I'm coming back without question! :)"
7/15/14,0.342466856,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"Great people, genuine customer service and exceptional skills. Highly recommend to family and friends. Without a doubt, I will be returning for another haircut but since I was only visiting I'd hope they open in Texas. I love my new hair!!"
3/18/15,0.367037037,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"I've been coming here a very long time.  Always a great cut, always friendly service and fair price.  I prefer Lori as my barber, her mom used to cut my hair as a kid, but all Lori's staff are great.  15 years ago, I brought my wife here, now she's a loyal customer too.  They seem to take care of everyone: old, young, men and women.  I highly recommend."
8/14/14,-0.021666667,Negative,1,3.0 star rating,"Came here and had my haircut by one of the ladies who has been there a long time.  I won't name names or say how many years to avoid singling out any of the people who cut hair.  Over all I liked my haircut.  There's a few things they do here I don't care for.  One, other stylists/barbers who aren't doing anything, just sit there doing nothing, place is tiny and can't have a conversation w/barber without the ones who aren't doing anything to be in on the conversation, there's no music or anything to listen to.  Oh and at the end, my barber takes this hairbrush and brushes my hair with it, WTF?  My hair was cut very short mind you.  Plus, the brush not sure where it came from.  Then, your haircut does NOT include a wash prior and after cutting it.  If you want to have it washed, it costs extra, WTF?  I really liked my haircut though and I wanted to like the whole experience but maybe this place isn't for me."
4/18/14,0.4295,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"Great barbers here! Fast, friendly service and I get the best haircuts here.  Their prices are great, too.  Not as low as those ultra cheap barber shops, but nowhere near as high as the solons.  Very reasonable prices for the quality haircuts you get here."
4/3/14,0.86,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,Great place with great deals!!! If you want a good cut or whatever your in need of ask for Chantell she is amazing!!! She always knows what you want and how you want it always comes out great.
7/9/14,0.258874459,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,"Well I took the three men in my life here for haircuts. My husband is military and is very picky about his hair. They did a wonderful job. EXACTLY what he asked for when described. I loved it and asked them if they had time to do my two son's haircuts. I have a two year old and a five year old. My two year old was scared about having a haircut, but that isn't new. They were very patient as he fidgeted and moved around in the chair. he tried to grab the scissors once and they were prompt and aware.. very patient. Now my five year old happens to be more difficult as he cannot sit still.. they simply talked to him and made him aware of everything they were about to do and talked to him. He laughed and sat still. this was a first since he wouldn't sit still at all at the place I took him to in Irvine that is solely a kids haircutting place. I will return. I also have two daughters that will be needing haircuts soon and I would totally bring them too. Thank you for the wonderful cuts you will be seeing us soon!!!"
7/7/14,0.298134921,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,My first time with these barbers and I'm glad I stopped in. Followed my directions perfectly and gave me a solid haircut.
