2/6/18,0.323095238,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"For a consistently great cut, go to Joel.  If you're like me, it can be hard to communicate exactly what you're looking for. I have an idea of what I want, but, not the right words to convey it.  He's always understood the look I wanted and the end results have been better than what I was hoping for.  Joel is the barber most people wish that they had. He always finds time to accommodate schedules too and he's an all around good guy. I highly recommend him. It's a cool space, prices are fair, and there's convenient parking, behind the alley."
11/3/17,0.333291997,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This shop is great. It's clean, it smells nice, and, best of all, it's not intimidating--this has always been a problem for me: either it's loud music that makes me feel like I'm not cool enough to be there, or else I get poor to no service because I'm a masculine-presenting afab person. This shop has none of that.Long, the owner, was great. He made me feel welcome and he really listened to what I wanted instead of rushing ahead and making too many assumptions. Also, he let me come back the following day when something wasn't sitting quite right, so now my hair is perfect. Thanks, Long!!"
4/7/18,0.4,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"They do a quality job. I literally said do whatever you want, I don't care, and 30-40 minutes later I had a great style and a cleaned up beard looking good. I'll for sure go back."
4/1/18,0.316666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Joel and Long are some of the best stylist I've had the pleasure of doing business with. The barbershop is located in a great spot to get a nice clean cut and hot shave before heading out for drinks. The inside invites you to stay, but the stylish cuts force you to show off the fresh dew. Cold beers and a chill vibe is what keeps me coming back."
2/28/18,0.1625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,My husband has been going to Long for years and he's never had a cut he didn't like. His technique for fades is impeccable. Definitely recommend Long to anyone that is picky with their hair.
3/26/18,0.2475,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Monday at 4PM ! No appt ! Long got me in and out ! Not only was it a great cut but he was very personable as well ! Thanks !
4/4/18,0.290178571,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Great place to get cleaned up before going out or to make as your go to barber. Friendly people and environment in a sick location for a good price.
3/3/18,0.5225,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Great environment and awesome haircuts. Long and Joel take great care of everyone that comes into the shop and offer an experience like no other barber shop I have ever been too
2/5/18,0.08,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Found this place by accident, Guys there are legit. Highly recommend trying them out for your next cut."
2/18/18,0.29,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Always my top choice to go for a haircut. The quality of the cut is on point every time, and the atmosphere is perfect for a chill time. Long's got some mad skills, ask for him for that top tier cut!"
3/3/18,0.3525,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"These guys are the best at what they do. Joel is the man and you won't be disappointed with your haircut. Awesome environment, highly recommend."
8/10/17,0.177222222,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Excellent haircut for my teenage son.  He's been looking for a barber who understands his ""fashion sense."" Long not only listens but recommends styles and cuts that works for his hair texture.  Extremely satisfied that his initial cut took about 30 minutes.  At a typical barber, he would be in and out in less than 15 minutes. The location is on the 2nd floor to the left of Goat Hill Tavern.  Highly recommend Ronin for cuts.  BTW, my daughter got a beautiful undercut here as well."
2/11/18,0.315,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Great service awsome barbers I highly recommend going here and will be going back. Parking is slim worth the walk if needed
6/20/17,0.379487179,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Long is very inviting and does his best to give you the hairstyle you want. He will offer his expertise and can keep a conversation. The vibe is super cool, it's a mix of modern and old. Old school barber chairs with modern accents. I asked him for a fade and the fade turned out awesome! Fair price and great customer service, I will definitely be back!"
3/12/18,0.39,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Not only is Long an amazing barber, but he's an amazing person. I always look forward to getting a cut and talking with him. I won't be going anywhere else to get a cut. I truly appreciate your work. You give off great vibes ."
1/27/18,0.131628788,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Fantastic boutique with a very approachable staff. I had my hair cut by Long and I'm pleased to say I've found my new spot. Previously I've gone to The Today Barber and was tired of the lines. Besides being close and easy to access there's ample parking.
11/25/17,0.216,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,I did my haircut here many time. Long is very professional person. He pays attention to every detail and most do appointments only. I would recommend this barber shop to anyone.
12/13/17,0.225641026,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Great local spot. Long (owner) has his business dialed. Got me an appointment last minute, prompt response via Yelp, did a fantastic haircut, was quick but detail oriented, and very knowledgeable and professional. Everything a barber should be. Cool location and awesome feng shui-not your everyday barber shop with obnoxious music and tacky graffiti everywhere. Definitely will be back"
6/18/17,0.361607143,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Contacted Long to book an appointment... Got an appointment right away! Got a beard trim and hair cut for myself... never been more happier. Atmosphere is great and Long is a perfectionist when it comes to hair! Love this place!
9/24/17,0.095,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"A few years ago I asked a friend if he had a recommendation for a barber. I was looking for a place I could have a regular person cutting my hair so I walk in and things just happen to my hair and I feel great about it. Everything a regular guy wants: no fuss, just a good cut at a fair price and a cold beer if I'm in the mood. With Ronin, I got what I was looking for. Long is the man and treats his customers like family. Five stars and 10/10 every time."
12/2/17,0.267892157,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Made an appointment with Long the day before. Super convenient. Came in and was instantly greeted and offered a drink. Long was finishing up a prior client so I had a chance to check out the place before hand. It was clean and the decor was fitting. The music selection was on point as well. He finished up with his client and formally greeted me and proceeded to ask me what I had in mind for my hair. I showed him a couple options and he helped me decide on the best one. He would pause to show progress on major parts of the cut to ensure everything looked fine. Also helped me get the best shape for my beard. After the cut was done he washes my hair and styled it. Showed me a few techniques to help keep the style in for the whole day. This shop deserves more than 5 stars for how professional and friendly they are. Will definitely be a repeat customer.
2/23/18,0.340952381,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Ronin Barber Shop is the best. My dad and I go there every 2 weeks. Long is super nice and gives tight cuts.
12/28/17,0.41,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"First time here, and I had a great experience. These guys spend time with their clients to make sure each one is satisfied with their cut. I'm looking forward to coming back here."
12/17/17,0.288636364,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I found Ronin Barber on Google Maps and was impressed by their Reviews on Yelp. I took a chance and walked in without an appointment. Long was in the middle of a cut but very welcoming. He worked me in to his schedule. I came back an hour later, he was ready for me, and took his time listening to my needs. Really impressive fade and haircut! Very reasonable prices! I will be back for sure."
12/13/17,0.61,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Excellent.  Joel was awesome.  Gave me a good haircut and trimmed my beard.  Such a relaxed environment and the dude is juss cool as heck.
10/13/17,0.216666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Long is legit. Incredibly talented and a master of his craft. I can't stop looking at my hair. Will definitely be back.
8/3/17,0.229166667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Joel really knows how to give a clean cut and fade and its a cool hangout environment. I've become a regular.
7/14/17,0.2625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Dude paid extra close detail to the lines of my side burns and beard which I always appreciate. It was my first time coming in and I am really happy with how I look. I've been to a lot of different barbers in the area and if you are looking for someone to take care of you just come on it.
7/29/17,0.229487179,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I had the pleasure of getting Long as my barber and it was a great experience. Firstly he was kind enough to open on Sunday to give me a cut, when he was technically closed. Which is in my book above and beyond. The hair cut was great and the conversation was really enjoyable. I have had another barber for a while now near my office and I will be changing to Ronin, based on my first experience. A Costa Mesa hidden gem."
7/28/17,-0.03125,Negative,1,2.0 star rating,2,Ok barber shop / men's salon. Don't be fooled by the one $. This is not an expensive barber. This is a men's salon with salon pricing! And honestly I am not impressed with the cut. It was ok but nothing to brag about.
1/11/18,0.75,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Awesome haircut. Two excellent barbers. Fair price cool spot. Good parking. Recommend.
6/24/17,0.4125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"My husband has been a client of Long since 2014, and drives over 30 miles one way to get his haircut. This should tell you how good this guy is! Not only is he a barber but a great friend, just a stand up dude. He is meticulous at his work and has created a cool environment at Ronin. Martin loves you!"
12/14/17,0.183333333,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,"Great guy and haircut. .  Would give this 4stars for the cut,  but pretty expensive.  Should be $$."
1/7/18,0.21038961,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,First review on Yelp.  New to the area so decided to trust yelp for a new spot and it did not disappoint.  Long did an awesome job and I will definitely be a regular here going forward.  Definitely recommend this spot.
8/3/17,0.275,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I've been going going to the same barbershop for years. I noticed Ronin Barbershop's bright neon sign on Newport Blvd. I booked an appointment through Yelp. Long got back to me immediately. I'm very happy with the service. I'm going back once every 2 weeks ...
7/28/17,0.55625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Such a nice barber shop, quality work and a great atmosphere!! I have many friends who go here and I'll continue to send people Longs way! ‍"
9/20/17,0.298666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Just recently started coming to them and they do an incredible job! Their place is super relaxing and laid back. I highly recommend this place.
6/15/17,0.152083333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Drove all the way from the Bay Area just for Long to cut my hair! Chillest place to get cut and you'll always get a clean cut.
7/22/17,0.248666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I have been getting my hair cut from Long for years.  Super laid back shop.  Great customer service.  Highly recommend.
5/16/17,0.06769697,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I would give this 6 stars if i could. Seriously, (and as you've probably read in other reviews) Long is dedicated to his trade and a master in his art. This shop is highly recommended even for the people that don't know much about their hair preference. His suggestions will take you from zero to hero. Don't come here if you want to remain a zero.The customer service definitely goes unmatched. Phone chargers, beverages, and a back patio to chill are some of the amenities available to all clients. The overall vibe and mood once inside the shop is very relaxed and friendly. It reminds me of how the movies portray how an old-school barber shop is supposed to function. There's another gentleman there that cuts hair also, Joel. If i hadn't met Long first, I'm positive he would've been my go to guy. Long was out of town one week and Joel actually stayed back to accommodate my schedule and it was at his suggestion. Great cut, would come back, 11/10. If you have an unpleasant experience at this shop, you might be the problem, you punk."
5/18/17,0.340277778,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Best place in town by far. Way better than the standard 10$ chop shops and way more normal than the men's salons that are all over town. Hair cut was awesome and quick. In and out in 20 min, just make sure you look at the yelp map because the iPhone will lead you to the wrong place. I will for sure be going back soon."
4/19/17,0.258571429,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,My mom and dad used to complain that I would spend $25 on a hair cut. So they made me go to a $5 hair cut shop. After they saw the difference between the cheap shop and Longs hair cuts they didn't open their mouths about getting my hair cut for $25. Long is not only my barber but he has become a friend that I can talk to while I get my hair cut. I highly recommend Ronin barbershop if you are wanting to have a great guy cut your hair and make you look 10x better than you looked when you walked in there.
6/19/17,0.210714286,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Come here and you won't go anywhere else again!   Small barber shop that gives you personal service you won't get at any large shop.  Cool chill ambiance with people that are the best in their craft.  See Long- he's the man.
6/23/17,0.264393939,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Long is the best stylist i have ever had. I used to live away for a couple of years and I would plan my trips back home in a way that I would be able to get my haircuts here. I currently live in Laguna Niguel and its a 30 miles drive to come see Long but I like his work so much that i wouldn't go anywhere else. He provides such good quality haircut for such an amazing price.
5/13/17,0.533333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Freshest cut in OC. Long is a master at his craft. Great prices. Beautiful shop. Been his client for 3 years now. I'll never let anybody else cut my hair.
3/25/17,0.17,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Ronin is my go-to barbershop in Orange County. Long and his crew are all very professional, courteous, and dedicated to their craft. Look no further for haircuts of any style!"
2/25/17,0.5515625,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Been coming to this barbershop now for a year and its the BEST! Long and Mikey are very friendly and know what they are doing! Customer service it top notch they will always greet you and make sure that they know what you want before  they start  to work on you! They have the attention to detail you need :) I dont trust anyone with my hair except  these guys!
5/25/17,0.007222222,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Every time I come to this place I feel welcomed, I have never walked out disappointed with my hair cut, and Long is always willing to accommodate you in his super busy schedule.. highly recommended place."
3/10/17,0.108761905,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This review is for Long. Long has been cutting my hair for the past 8 years. Even when I moved to LA and tried to find a barber, I would return to OC once it got long enough for long to fix. No lie, along is a trend setter and knows exactly the right look for the right individual. The best part about this shop is the conversation and neighborhood feel. It feels really good to support local businesses--even if I 'rep LA now. Highly recommended"
3/9/17,0.053,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"My boyfriend has been Longs client for the past 5 years. Long the Barber is a master at his craft. Very cool retro barber shop, we highly recommend Long at Ronin Barber Shop."
5/13/17,0.262142857,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been coming to Long (the owner of Ronin) for more than 3 years. He always keeps my hair looking good, and it's always a pleasure just hanging out in the shop. If Long can't cut your hair, the other barbers always do a good job as well. I highly recommend if you are in the OC area."
4/22/17,0.2525,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Long always takes care of me when I call or text for a cut. Professional and doesn't make me wait when I need to get in there. Highly recommend for a great men's haircut.

7/31/17,0.144642857,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Best haircut I've gotten in a long time. A little more expensive than other barbers in the area but worth it to me!
12/28/16,0.333094618,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Wow!!! Best barbershop in town!!! Great cuts and A+++ customer service. Price is very competitive compared to other shops nearby. If you're looking for a great cut, and be treated like royalty I would come down to Ronin and ask for Long."
3/28/17,0.291666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I've had the pleasure of being Long's client for almost 2 years. He always makes sure you are satisfied before you leave. Customer service and satisfaction is clearly his top priority. Will continue to go to him and would highly recommend to everybody!
6/19/17,0.287,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Love the way my Buzz cut gets done at this barbershop! I highly recommend a buzz by Long and Joel. Place looks super clean A+++++
7/7/17,0.251,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Awesome barbershop! I walked in at the end of the day and they were nice enough to seat me for a cut.  Long is very knowledgeable and takes the time to understand what kind of haircut you want. Highly recommended and i'll definitely be coming back for my next cut.
3/9/17,0.305555556,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Long is the best barber around. I have been going to Long for haircuts for 3 years and have always walked out extremely happy. He cares about his clients and will take his time to make sure you walk out with the best haircut you've ever had. Definitely check this place out if you want a fresh haircut, you will not be disappointed."
9/5/17,0.192857143,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I got two haircuts from Joel and it has been Fantastic. Not only was he able to get me a fresh cut, he got me in and out the door (I usually get my haircut during lunch break) He's also a chill dude who really listens to you and deliver what you want and how you want your hair to look. HIGHLY RECOMMEND JOEL!"
6/19/17,0.285714286,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,One the best haircuts and experiences I have ever had at a barber shop. Long was cool and worked out a good deal for me. Definitely coming back again. You can't beat the overall experience for the price.
6/11/17,0.387083333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been getting cuts from Long at Ronin Barber for almost 4 years now. He is one of the few people I've met who consistently give me perfect cuts. One time one of his mates at other shop butchered my hair and when I went back to fix it he was gone and Long stepped up and fix it and refuse payment. That's the kind of person Long is and that's why I followed him when he opened his own shop farther from my home. He has great dedication to his craft and puts a lot of attention to detail. Added to his mastery is his friendliness, he will always meet you with a smile and I've had very good conversations while I'm sitting there. Getting a perfect cut and relaxing before and while you get it is why you should check out Ronin Barber. The place has a super good vibe too!"
3/15/17,0.22797619,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"If you are in Newport and want a real mans haircut, look no further than the samurai barber long! Have some patients and let the guy do what he wants, you will be beyond stoked. Never have I see such a clean fade! Proud to have it on my head."
3/27/17,0.352155483,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Long has always taken great care of my hair needs and love the new shop in Costa Mesa across from The Triangle. Cheap cuts with fresh looks, he always has the mentality, ""customer is always right"" which I respect. Always easy to book an appointment and you can pay via Venmo which makes things easier for the client, as well. Keep up the great work Long, love the new barber shop and name!"

12/1/16,0.121928419,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"As an 8 year, active duty, military VET I'm well versed in having to get regular haircuts on a bi-weekly basis. The entire time I was in the NAVY it's a damn shame I didn't have Long Nguyen to trim my fade up. Hands down and by far the MOST SKILLED barber I've had the pleasure of cutting my hair and beard (#dirtycivilian). So thoughtful, pleasant, and accommodating. The guy is willing to do anything to get you the cut you deserve! Well done sir, well done. 5 Stars all day! *****"
