1/13/18,0.157924107,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I'm writing this review after 1 full year of Nate cutting my hair.  First off, WOW - I've never seen anyone like Nate.  No other shops out there will open as early as 6:00AM-6:30AM to make sure you're ready for a crazy week at work.  He responds at light speed on appointment requests.If I could give Nate's Barbershop more than 5 stars, I would.  Nate is an incredibly talented hair stylist.  I'm very particular with my hair.  Beyond common belief, short hair is very difficult to get right.  I've gotten my hair cut from many places in San Francisco, but Nate's is the BEST.There are three adjectives I would use to describe Nate:- Consistent: Nate has locked-in exactly what haircut I want.  I just sit in that chair and he does his magic.- Precise: Nate's attention to detail is incredible.  He's the only haircutter I know that can work this fast and with this much attention to detail.- Passionate: Nate started cutting hair from way back when.  He has a natural knack for it.  He has a passion for making people look good and feel good.It's $45 (or $50 for early bird), but worth every cent for the professionalism and craftsmanship of Nate.  The quality of his work always shines through.Lastly, SUPPORT a local business!  Nate is doing many renovations and he's working hard to expand and provide an even better experience.  The remodeled shop has a Keurig, TV, and many other perks for customers.I just got my haircut this morning to kick-off my weekend.  As always, thank you, Nate!"

Not Nate, on the same day I sent him a message requesting an appointment for my son to get a haircut and he responded quick with the time that worked best for me. As Nate was cutting my son's hair, he was detailed, took his time,keeping everything even, sides cut even, hairline clean. My teen son commented that he felt comfortable in the shop and felt comfortable with Nate cutting his hair. Its hard to find people that you can trust to do hairThe location is a little hard to see but its one of those places that is a hole in the wall that unless you walk in you will not know how great they are. Nate was  very respectful, quiet, detailed work, clean. Nate has skills and you can tell he likes doing what he does. At other barbershops/salons I have taken my son to other barbershops or salons, people can be rude and not always listen to what their client wants.I think that this will be the place where I will take my son from now on."

He came back looking great and said the service was really good. Nate is a friendly and humble dude.  Didn't have an appointment but reached out to Nate through yelp and got a 10:30am appointment on a Saturday before the Christmas holiday, no problem.The cut was fast but the quality was still really excellent. He came back with a nice bald taper and all the edges looked great and the fade on the sides was good. Would recommend to anyone who is in the area."

3/15/18,0.326623377,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Great haircut! I got in on early Tuesday afternoon so   having made the appointment thru the yelp app. Pretty happy I found this place as I've been looking for a barber shop that's close to where I live (outer mission). He accepts credit cards which is great.Will definitely come back for another haircut.
1/25/18,0.3,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Nate responded to my request for an appointment within 5 mins . The Lady That cut my 3 yr old  son hair did a really good job . Actually the best hair cut he had . Definitely coming back once his hair grows out .

3/24/18,0.320454545,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Nate's Barbershop is the place to go.This is the first time I ever got a haircut at a barbershop and I have been treated like a regular here. The environment was friendly, everyone was comfortable and, even though this was my first time here, I felt comfortable. I asked for a combover with tapers on the side and came out with exactly that, simple but the cut was amazing. I walked out of there feeling real good about my haircut, definitely recommend this place."
2/27/18,0.110416667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I have an interview tomorrow and decided that I needed to get my goatee cleaned up.  Sent Nate a note and he responded in less than 5 minutes and told me he could get me in now!!  Walked in and had to wait 2 minutes as he finished up with his current cut and then boom I was in the chair and he cleaned it up in just a few minutes and I was on my way looking good for tomorrow.  Thanks Nate!!

3/13/18,0.352777778,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Found this barbershop on yelp as well as had a recommendation to go see Nate, when looking for a place to get my sons haircut. It was a pleasant experience to go into a shop where the barber is professional and has a cool conversation. He was quick, efficient and you can tell he enjoys his craft because it shows in his work. My son liked his haircut as well as I did too, that I brought in 3 of my nephews the following day!"

3/31/18,0.557142857,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,Nice barber. Nice cuts.  Nice clean shop.  Super pricy. Good on the hair cut but not so good on the beard.  Keep in mind there is no parking in the area you might have to park 2 blocks away on the streets. I do recommend him tho.
2/20/18,0.136136364,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I'm fairly new to the area so I've been looking for a barbershop. I was looking online and saw Nate's Barbershop. It's open early so you don't have to plan your whole day around a midday haircut.  He also accepts walk-ins which is a big plus since I'm not really one for appointments. Nate's Barbershop is very convenient for me. I received my long overdue haircut and he did a really good job too! Definitely recommend others to check out this spot.
7/14/17,0.396666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This was my first time here, he was awesome very nice and sweet. He did as I asked him to do, my design is dope, and he had a credit card machine double plus. I will be back!!!"
12/21/17,0.506076389,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Phenomenal haircut for my son! We were in the area and luckily stumbled upon this hot spot for guys! Nate is quick, has attention to detail and his fades are hands down the best I've seen. I'm a perfectionist and can honestly say Nate gave my son a great cut! 10 stars! Thank you"
2/17/17,0.647619048,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Nate squeezed me in last minute on a Thursday before I was headed out of town. I was in and out in under 30 mins. Great haircut! Did an excellent fade and excellent job lining up my beard as well. Location is convenient right off the M muni line for any SFSU students looking to get a nice haircut close to campus.
9/10/17,0.330235043,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"I got a great haircut from Nate. The place might not look like much, but when I was waiting for my haircut (about 45 minutes, good time for there being 3 people before me waiting for one barber!) it was really comfortable and fun listening to Nate talk to some regular customers. He didn't flinch when I sat down and asked him to shave about 7-8 inches of hair down to a buzzcut (clipper length about 4 at the top). He knew what length would suit my face, which is great for a girl who's never gone that short. It took maybe 15 minutes and the cut is super even! I watched him do really crisp cuts on the guys before me like it was nothing too. He knows what he's doing!"
12/26/17,0.08,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Quick and clean cuts. One of the few places that still accepts walk-ins. I was a bit confused on the pricing, but cut is actually worth the price."
1/9/18,0.216004584,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"New to the beard game and kinda used to just trim and line up myself. Went on a vacation to Colombia and the barbershops out there opened my eyes to how it should look and how a real line up should be done. Came back to the city on a mission to duplicate that standard and Nate came through! I looked up a few spots, Nate was close and had great reviews so I shot him a message on yelp. He replied right away and set me up with a same day appointment. The guy before me looked clean and seemed like a regular so I felt secure. Nate works quick and lined me up real good! He gave me his number and I'll be going back for sure. Thanks man!"
12/11/17,0.5125,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Great hair cut. Best I've had in years. This was my first time at Nate's place and I'll definitely be back.
3/8/18,0.377777778,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Great haircut. She took her time and I'd recommend this place. Looks like they are currently under renovation but I got in quick.
12/18/17,0.170989583,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Found Nate's through yelp.. Set up my appt yesterday night for monday morning. Less than 10 minutes reply from Nate's the owner.

11/26/17,0.217447917,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Got a cut from Nate a little while back, havent had time to  leave a review until today. So my experience here was really great, nate's a real people person. I made a reservation through yelp, nate replied in less than an hour. Made me feel welcome and was real hospitable. Cut was quick and clean. I didnt realize i had made my appointment for a day the shop was closed, but nate still was able to accomodate me, i thought that was real dope of him to do especially given my hectic and odd work schedule. Would definitely recommend nate to anyone looking for a good cut"
11/10/17,0.058333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Nate hooked it up with a clean taper, came out exactly how I wanted it. Friendly and the wait wasn't bad at all, will be coming back again."
6/29/17,0.385069444,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Nate gave my son an amazing haircut and is a super hard working and nice guy as well.  He was detailed yet quick and his he knows what a young man (aka tween) would like in a haircut, so I did not have to do much explaining and micromanaging.  What a bonus that the shop opens at 6:00AM!!! Perfect for families on the go."
12/4/17,0.491666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Nate is a great barber and with skill. Great with customer service and also very well oriented with his piece. He knows how to always make me look good and feel like HECTOR... Glad he's around the neighborhood and always has it's doors open. Thank you for your great service and I will still continue to get cut by a real true professional. HUGO CHAVEZ...
12/2/17,0.31,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Great service. Friendly. Accessible hours. Will come back and make this my regular barber.
2/25/17,0.033333333,Positive,0,2.5 star rating,2.5,"Only reason why I gave a harsh rating is because I waited 2.5 hours for a cut and it did not come out the way I asked for. Also somebody could've said ""come back in 2 hours we got a long line"" but there wasn't any consideration, nor way of know if you were next. Kinda had to ask each barber how many appointments he has I guess lolI showed Nate a picture of Conor McGregor and I came out looking like a wannabe Neymar..... Pretty pissed but actually got a hold of Nate and he said he would fix it so final outcome of hair is TBD!All in all, chill environment, typical locker room talk setting."
10/3/17,-0.141666667,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,Never leave Nate's disappointed with a cut! Straight razor shaves with hot towel are on point!
9/13/17,0.327272727,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,Nate responded immediately to an appointment request and was able to make a same day cut & shave for my son who's new to SF.  Excellent job!!  We'll be back! Kudos!
1/18/18,0.014285714,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I was enough gf cut my hair late one night after the bars. To say the least, she a natural disaster level screw up with the fade. Nate not only fixed her f-up, he blended it and made it 10x better."
1/16/18,0.175,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Needed a cut so bad because my barber was out of town, so I texted Nate through Yelp if he had an available slot asap. He responded within 10 minutes and, 1 hour later, I was getting one of the best fades I've ever had."
7/25/17,0.666666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Got my haircut here with Nate as a walk in. He gave me a #2 bald taper and it was perfect. I also got my beard shaved and it came out great. Highly recommend going to Nate's!
5/19/17,0.188141026,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I got a cut from Jonathan. He put a lot of effort into my haircut. Spent almost an hour on it. He was very polite and pleasant. I could tell he tried to cut my hair exactly how I wanted. The reason for the low rating is that the haircut didn't come out very well at all. It seemed pretty good at first but after a better look I realized it looked pretty bad. Granted cutting my hair well is hard, I was still expecting better results judging by the ratings of the place. I think this place might be better for those with short hair and not for someone with long hair that needs a more complicated cut. I would still recommend this place for those with short hair because they seem to do a better job with the trimmer than with the scissors. It's also possible the haircut would have come out better if Nate gave me the haircut, he seems to be more experienced than Jonathan."
7/13/17,0.101553481,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Nate's is my new go-to and I'm sad I found them right before I had to move away. Having lived my whole life in northern California, I've seen a range of barbers, their prices, their attention to detail and their customer service. Nate's hands down wins in all of those.It was easy to make an appointment (they accept walk-ins too but call ahead). Got seated as soon as I walked in and walked out with a clean fade for $35 (didn't have enough for tip by the way because I was looking at old prices). My first impression was that they are a humble group of guys who work hard and aim to do good by the customer. They are remodeling at the moment and I'm looking forward to seeing how it looks next time I come back to visit."
9/4/17,0.343333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Nate provides quality service at a decent price. One simply cannot ask for much more than that. Moreover, he's a great guy and he's willing to work around any schedule."
7/27/17,0.666666667,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,If you haven't been to Nate's Barbershop you better go now they give the best haircut's. I been to a lot of haircut places this place is on the top of my list if I'm around the daly city area.
1/25/17,0.120757576,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Nate, you made me a new person! I had not seen a barber in over a year. I was way overdue. I messaged him on Yelp and scheduled an appointment for the next day. Very quick response. I came in looking ragged and left looking like G-Eazy. Tip him big, he deserves it!"
9/28/17,0.420833333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Best haircut I've had in a long time. It was a bit busy, but definitely worth the wait. Great attention to detail and friendly."

9/19/17,0.34,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Nate did a helluva good job. Decent price for the quality you're getting and he did it in a timely manner. I was in and out of there quick. Going back for sure
12/13/17,0.435714286,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,First time ever getting my beard done by a barber. Really impressed. Nate knows what he's doing. Warm and welcoming guy followed by a super clean look. I'll be back for sure.
12/26/17,0.141666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Nate went above and beyond. Day after Christmas and desperately needed a cut, every barber was booked so I called Nate on a whim and he dropped what he was doing to fit me in within the hour. Very helpful, friendly and gave me an amazing fresh cut in 30 minutes. I will definitely be returning for my next cut."
10/1/16,0.163006611,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Perhaps the best fade I've ever gotten. So my barber left for vacation and I needed a cut badly because I had a dinner to attend to and it was Thursday night. Knowing the next day is Friday (the busiest day for barber shops) I was a little stressed because I had average-at-best experiences going to a new barber. After looking listings after listings on Yelp for over 30 minutes I still couldn't decide which one to go to because most of them require making an appointment. Finally I came across Nate's listing and saw that he opens at 730am and I knew there's a bi chance that this owner is legitimate if he opens that early. I decided I would give him a call at 7am to try to make an appointment. I called Nate at 7am Friday morning and I could hear him cutting someone's hair already and he told me he has four more guys waiting and he only do walk ins so just stop by the shop around 930 after the morning rush. I said Koo. And I thought I liked two things right there-- first he was there BEFORE 730 (the listed opening time) cutting hair and he had people lining up waiting for him that early so he must be good; second thing is he only takes walk ins which means he's all business and he doesn't like to waste time, just feels less pretentious then those higher end barber shop that requires booking days sometimes weeks in advance. Long story short, I got to Nate's shop at 930 and all four chairs were full but I was first one up and it so happened that I ended up in Nate's chair. The hair cut was quick and smooth. Nate was very easy going and Koo to talk to and the end result was a fresh, clean looking fade. The girl I went to dinner that night told me it was a nice hair cut and she's pretty picky .One thing that resonated with me was when I asked Nate how come he only do walkins he told me it's because he doesn't want to turn anyone away and he'll always try to work something out with the customer if timing/scheduling is off. THAT, is at the HEART of customer service--which is how can he help?! Nate, thank you. You guys are going to do great! See y'all soon."
6/20/17,-0.133333333,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,"Legit spot, old school neighborhood barber feel with all the skills of the ""hot tickets"" spots around. Go get cut here, you shouldn't be disappointed."
5/20/17,0.4,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Jordan... is the man do see. This man finesses the clippers and always kills the hair cut, the straight shave is a nice touch as well. 10/10 would recommend this place to everyone."
7/14/17,0.091666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Nate is one of the best barbers I've been to. Seriously came in as a walk in, asked if he had time and he said "" I got three peopke ahead of you"". I didnt mind a wait, I thought about 2 hours and Ill get in the chair. Nope he got me in with in an hour and got me out in 30 minutes. Highly recommended!"
6/8/17,0.16,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Had to get a last minute cut and my usual barber was out of town so I hit up Nate and he was prompt in setting up my appointment. I got a skin fade combover and a lineup and he did a great job and didn't take that long at all. Also, I was able to get cut by 8am which is a lot earlier than most barbers start working. He'd already been cutting before I even got there. Definitely recommend Nate he did a good job"
10/12/16,0.163333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Needed a fade, called in and Nate hooked it up! The shop is fairly small, but it's more than enough for what you need. I told him what I wanted and Nate made sure it was proper. Not much more to say, but Nate gives a quality fade and I was super happy with the outcome. Will definitely be coming back when I need a haircut."
6/3/17,0.154166667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Pretty dope barbershop. Got cut by the boy Nate himself! Fresh and fast cut. Nate loves what he does and you can see him do that with your hair. The results are awesome the only complaint I may have is that he charges around $35 for a fade cut. But other than that solid work, I'll be back!"
8/14/17,0.304415584,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Need a last minute cut for a job interview. Nate took me right away. Came out looking like a new man. If attention to detail is your thing or you got a nice healthy beard like me this is the spot to get cut at.

I went in a Monday morning, not many barber shops in the area are open, so I'm happy this was. Nate helped me, and I was very happy with his service overall. Thanks for everything Nate Dogg, see you again soon!"
9/21/17,0.174965278,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Nate is a modern day samurai! Since moving to San Francisco a few months ago I've been trying different barbershops in the City in the hopes I find the one that I can become a regular. This city has a lot of good barbers whose clientele cater to the affluent tech industry. A lot of the established places try to justify the high cost of getting a haircut by impressing you with their shops ambiance and a complimentary beer or two while you wait for your haircut. Nate's Barbershop is none of those. This is a no frills place hidden in the Oceanside part of town. The regulars come here because they know that Nate is master of his craft. Oftentimes it takes 3 or 4 visits to a barber before they get the nuance of your hair. Nate nailed my haircut on my first visit. From fades to pompadours or any hairstyle you might want on your next haircut, this is the place to go. I suggest you make an appointment as this place gets busy regardless of what time of the day it is. The 100+ 5 star reviews don't lie! I look forward going to Nate's Barbershop exclusively for my haircut from now on. Cheers!"
5/16/17,0.37,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Tried many haircut places in the past here in SF, and never got the same results than as I did here. Nates Barbershop is truly one of a kind, and Nate himself did a great job in fulfilling what I wanted for a haircut.REALLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"
6/7/17,0.33675,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Get my haircut here all the time. Nate is my barber and he's always solid and consistent. He's always flexible on time. If you need an early morning cut ask him and he'll most likely be there.I've seen good work from the other barbers as well, and each of them excel in their own style of cutting so make sure to see who would be the best fit for the cut you want. I will say this, EVERYONE there knows how to give a good fade. The first time I went in happened to be their anniversary for opening and I was a bit reluctant to switch barbers but I have no regrets. They had drinks and pizza out for their crew, but offered some food to my friends and I on our first visit. You can tell these guys care about establishing relationships with their clients. Good people with great skills with some of the most affordable prices in SF. I highly recommend this place."

Suggesting styles that would match your hair and more. Get a hair cut from this guy!!! From the start to all the way to the end of the haircut, he puts 100% of his effort.

Have you all ever gotten a real haircut?? I swear that a lot of these 5 stars reviews are given to themselves by the very same barbers who create fake yelp profiles to boost their star rating..  this butcher Nate...I mean barber if I can really call him that also had the nerve to ask me to give him a review on yelp lol.. well here it goes partner...oh by the way if you chance going there try to get there an hour before your appointment so you can find parking and pray your car does not get broken into."

This one was the only one I had a good feeling about and that feeling was right. The vibe was good and so was the vibe of my barber. He's chill and he did an amazing job. This will probably be the only barbershop I will go to. I totally recommend getting your hair cuts here.

We had tried a few places in the Bayview but, hey sometimes things fade away(lol).So, I went to Yelp and was looking for a Barber in the Oceanview area my old neighborhood where I grew up. So naturally I turned to to Yelp and once again the almighty Yelp has not let me down, yet!Nate's barbershop was not only one of the cleanest shops we have been to in San Francisco but, they were extremely friendly and very professional. I was impressed by their concentration level while working on each clients head for they all were completely engaged and into their art of greatness! Nate got my son in his chair pretty fast and it was not a long wait at all. It was a great environment and positively entertaining with a great NBA basketball game on I was happy I did not miss watching #KingJames play. ;-).I showed Nate 2 pictures and he delivered and gave my son a better hair cut than ""The Clay Thompson Bald side Fade"" Cut! ;-) My son was happy and so, was I! Yes, it is worth $20 especially when you see Nate use the Old school ""straight-edge razor"" and tops the ending of the haircut with his skills. . . .wow! Now that was impressive and really showed off his level of expertise and skills in his profession.Thank you Nate! My son is really happy with his new cut and you did an ""AWESOME"" job. We will be back and even when we move to Sacramento when we are in town we will come by to see you. -Aminah & Z"

My hair would be cut all different ways and I would always end up shaving it off or fixing the different lengths. Most months, I went to my barber in Fresno because I couldn't find a decent barber.Today I walked into Nate's and Mike cut my hair well. I'm excited to be able to have a new barber I can go to biweekly. My hair and beard looked awesome walking out! I made an appointment for 2 weeks out and I am stoked to have a new place to get my cut!"

1/30/16,0.053794643,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Nate has always been super accommodating whenever my regular barber isn't available. I shoot him a text the day before I need to come in and my appointment is locked in. When I get there, I only have to wait +/- 15 mins because a cut is running a bit behind or someone had a previous appt who hasn't gone up yet.The haircut itself is meticulous despite how fast he cuts. Although my current cuts have been relatively simple (mid fade & line up while leaving the length up top) because I'm growing my hair out, I still feel he does a commendable job. I've even received compliments when I'm out after I get a cut. I definitely recommend Nate's if you're in the neighborhood and are looking for a barber. Definitely my go-to when my regular guy is unavailable.PRO-TIP: Don't park right in front unless you want someone to box you in until their cut is finished. Had to learn that the hard way. Park around the corner or a couple blocks away."

Only shop that I know of that all barbers can cut. You can't go wrong with any of them. Best shop hands down. Each barber is unique in their own way and that comes from leadership. They give you that old school feel with new school vibes. They give you that comfort feel of what a barber shop is. Come and check them out, be aware tho at times it may get crowded so always call in advance. Dope shop."
11/14/16,0.35,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I had a wonderful experience at Nate's. Top notch hair cut and Nate is an upstanding guy who cares about his customers. I will definitely be coming back again. ;)
9/23/14,0.137799874,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I called ahead & was lucky enough to get a ""drop in"" appointment. After my cut started, the line formed quickly. Like any shop, make sure you don't just show up unless you've got nowhere to be. Nate's is a little off the beaten path. So I got to park across the street easily, but it's also not really near anything so don't expect other hidden gems, (At least I didn't see anything else). Make sure your phone is charged so you stay busy during your wait cuz the tv will be behind your head until you're in a chair.Styling for the cut was straight forward & precise enough. I got my comb over & aside from the top being just a touch longer than usual it was pretty nice. See the pics. Price was average, $35 with tip. I'm a fan of the cut, & the guys here were cool. It's worth checking out if you are looking for a new spot.CHAD"
3/5/17,0.465277778,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I called Nate one Monday morning when I was looking for a place to cut my hair through Yelp and he told me to come in since he was free. He was quick with the cut (I got a 2 on the side and a trim on top and he was done within 30 minutes) and I came out with an awesome haircut. Nate pays attention to detail and asks you specifically for what you want. There is also easy street parking near his shop. From now on I plan to set up an appointment with him!

5/25/16,0.25,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I think place is great for men only because the kid looked great that went before me. He didn't know how to separate my long hair or tie it up. I have various lengths of shaved hair some close to an inch long.
6/4/16,0.113299513,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This is a real easy 5. My current barber has been a bit unreliable (partially, he's not to blame. I'll leave the names out, but in all fairness the shop nearly closed a few months ago and some changes by the owner/management have shaken things up) While it's always hard to leave, I needed to check out something new. Plus, I was heading to my family reunion in Las Vegas for the weekend and had to get a cut. I texted Hector literally out of the blue and he responded right away and made excellent communication with me not only to book the appointment but about my expectations for the haircut. We made a 7:15am appointment on a Saturday morning (which, I had to let that soak in.) Hector arrived on time, greeted me by name and he was very professional (gloves, apron, clean station.) I gave him a brief description about how I wanted my hair cut and he nailed it -plain and simple."

I walked in and just took a seat and figured I'd get in when they were done with their appointments. As soon as a chair opened up, Nate waived me over to the chair and asked if I was the one that called. I showed him a pic of what I wanted (a fringe type haircut that was pretty different from what all the other barbers were doin) but said that he could do it. 15 min later I walk out with a fresh ass cut that my girl liked so I know it was good. Definitely will be coming back thanks Nate."

2/18/15,0.1828125,Positive,0,3 star rating,3,They get 5 stars just for being able to get me in on a Friday afternoon. -.5 star for a rushed haircut in and out in 15 minutes which can be good but I didn't like how square some of my hair looked. I have Long hair on top and short on the sides I guess he didn't want to risk cutting the long hair. Could be worse and he cut a lot of the long hair but instead didn't try to get in there and get close with the cut. -1.5 star for telling me the cut was $25 and then letting me know there was nothing I needed to sign after I swiped my card. Of course i cash tipped since i didnt have to sign. Much to my displeasure the charge on my cc wasn't 25 bucks. Only a couple bucks more but telling customers wrong prices while swiping isn't the best. Generous 3 stars. The guys were friendly and you can get a haircut in before the weekend which is really great.

It's a very friendly and open barber shop. There is always a sports discussion going down for anyone into sports. I myself don't care to speak but enjoy to hear the convos in the shop. Nate the owner is one of the most down to earth and best shop owners I have met. Each and every time I have come his customer service is above and beyond and his friendly and always willing to meet all my needs in the shave and cut I ask of him. He even has taken me at last notice last christmas eve! If you have not been to this hidden gem of a barber shop I suggest to give them a chance the next time you need a trim.

I understood that it was difficult to get a spot without an appointment but I walked in because the wait time wasnt so bad and I was rather desperate for a haircut. I literally went to every barber shop in Daly City and SSF that I knew of and every one of couldnt take me in. I asked for a mid bald fade and keep the top the way it is and man within ten minutes this guy whipped up his razors and did better than an average barber would in like 30-45 mins. Even prior to that he asked 2 men if it was cool if i go first because it was going to be quick and somewhat urgent and they happily obliged and Im guessing due to the fact that that they might know his ways. Last but not the least, five stars to the service and his desire to satisfy the customer but a life saving haircut after all the desparity. Right on Nate Bro. (Its a late review)"

Several times I've gone to this establishment only to find it closed during ""open hours"" leading customers to feel unvalued. Sure, the haircuts are decent but the intangibles are seriously lacking. These are the events that transpired... I get off work early at 3:00pm to get to Nate's at 3:30 to get my weekly cut. The door is closed and no one is to be found. I call Nate and he informs me that he is doing a bank deposit he will be back at 4:30. I wait an hour and still no Nate and barbershop closed (during open hours). I call Nate again and the response is unbelievable! ""I'm doing you a favor so just wait and I'll be there when I'm there."" I've been getting my hair cut from Nate for years mainly to support an old friend but if my giving him my money is a favor I'll take my business elsewhere. Anyone can cut a good head it's the other things such as reliability that make a barber superb. Until Nate learns the importance of professionalism and accountability this place will never see a dime from me again."

Been in San Francisco for only about a month now, I came up from LA and I struggled trying to find a legit clean cut barbershop for the first couple weeks. Before I came to this shop, some other barber messed up my hair completely, from my fade to my line up. Hector ended up cutting me up and he fixed it and hooked it up with a clean ass taper with line up. I'm looking for clean ass quality and Hector and his boys offers exactly that. I'm proud to say I found my barber here in SF. Everybody from SFSU should check out this shop."
2/24/14,0.312797619,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Just went to the hates for the first time last friday had to get a fresh cut for the weekend and Nate hooked it up. Dope shop right off the M line so easy access for sf state students and he accepts credit card which is unheard of at most barbershops. Got the shadow fade and Nate did work. if you want a fresh cut in sf I strongly recommend you check out Nates.

Nate gave me a clean taper fade and I'll definitely be back when I need another trim. If you want a great haircut, check this place out !"

The place is really nice on the inside and the chair is nice and comfy. He took all the extra steps to make sure i didn't get any bumps or cuts when he gave me the smoothest shave ever! Thanks Nate! And Go Giants and Niners!!!
