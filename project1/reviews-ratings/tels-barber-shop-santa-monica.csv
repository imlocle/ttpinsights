1/26/17,0.086344538,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"So you're a dude looking for a haircut on the westside. You could go to a Lloyd's or Floyd's or similar chain designed to project the image of an old-timey barbershop, or actually go to the old-timey barbershop those joints are modeled after.Tel's is a family establishment. Grandpa Tel is a barber. His sons Randy and Brian are barbers. His grandson Andrew is a barber. Those four people occupy the chairs at Tel's and it's been that way for God knows how long. There is something really special about a place where three generations of men cut hair right next to each other. There are no chairs rented to some doofy kid with no experience. No matter whose seat is open, you're getting a guy whose last name is Trujillo and who's been cutting hair as the family business his whole life.There aren't frills, really. The haircuts are $20 whether they use scissors or not. They don't offer a traditional straight shave. They haven't updated the model photos on their walls since the 80s but each of them knows how to cut your hair the way you want it, I promise. The shop is lost in a bygone era but their barbering skills are definitely not.My guy is Randy. I like to think he's the most versatile of the crew, but I couldn't say for sure. What I can say with certainty is this guy can cut some hair. And he has a gift for understanding what you want and making it happen.If you're looking for an old-school barber who's up to date on style, this is your shop."

My boyfriend is beyond picky and will wait till he travels back to Arizona to get his hair cut, however he found his guy and location. Yay.  I don't have to listen to him whine anymore ;-) thank you!"
8/5/17,0.520357143,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Always a great experience there. Everyone is very nice and friendly. I've been going for over 20 years now. I wouldn't go any other place. Andrew is my favorite and does an excellent job. Thanks guys!!
10/27/17,0.437272727,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Best haircut I've had. He took a look at my hair and new exactly what I needed. I left the shop looking and feeling great.
5/17/16,0.324479167,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Although Tel's is a usually busy place, there's many reasons for that. 1. Satisfaction: this family-owned business excel at meeting the needs of their customers. Very understanding and will work with you to ensure that you leave with a smile.2. Atmosphere: when I brought my father here for the first time he really enjoyed the friendly vibes and intellectual conversations that the barbers had for their  customers. The place also doesn't play any loud music and the layout of the store is simple and easy on the eyes (as opposed to Lloyd's barbershops) 3. Price: great if you are running on a strict budget. Tel's barbershop do not charge overwhelmingly for their services but their fine work always make me tip the barbers.4. Parking: it's not hard to find a parking space directly in front of the store, however, you can also park in the back alley but be sure to park in the spot designated for the shop. The locksmith next door nearly towed my car because I parked in their spot!5. Location: the store is in a nice, clean, and safe neighborhood. Across the barbershop is a park with basketball courts that you can use. It's always a good idea to take a walk around the area after your visit to show off your newly fresh cut.And even if the place is packed, remember that quality attracts customers. They deserve every penny heading their way. Looking forward to getting a cut from here whenever I need it."

Will come again, definitely call in before hand because they are busy sometimes.All of their barbers are amazing but I had Bryan and he was great, amazing to talk to, and really great with fades."
6/13/17,0.163888889,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Moved from San Diego to La and was spending double the price for average haircuts elsewhere. These guys are pros and do a great job. Be prepared to street park if you've never been in the area and also make sure you put enough in the meter just in case they're packed. I typically go in during my lunch break and I'm in and out within 30 minutes.
10/22/16,0.74375,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Very friendly staff. They talk to you patiently and appreciate your input.  One of the best barbershops in Santa Monica.
2/24/16,0.030378788,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I moved here a few months ago and went to a few local places in Santa Monica before going to Tel's. The Haircuts were sub par at the other shops. I found this place on Yelp and decided to check it out. I waited briefly and had a super friendly barber. He did a solid job! As long as I live in Santa Monica, I'm going to Tel's!"
5/13/15,0.101771429,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"I wish I could rate this family business higher.Very good vibe to this barber shop. I think they're all related (3 generations?). Always a friendly, quiet smile. Good clientele. I go when the wait is short - when you can see empty street parking. Solid conversation, if you want it. Half the time I go here, I get a good simple haircut. Not perfect but good for the price. Unfortunately, the other half of the time I visit, after I wash my hair it's very easy to see uneven spots - long sections that should have been easy to compare to the nearby hair during the cut.  After my last visit (probably the very last), I had to do some serious home-trimming to make it close to even.It's time for a family intervention. Do some test-cutting and discover that a certain someone needs to be reminded about that Comb-The-Hair-Up-And-Check-The-Length move that we've all seen."
8/12/15,0.308888889,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Stopped into Tel's one day because my hair was getting long and I needed a quick haircut to relieve me from the 90 degree weather. I was not disappointed and have found my newest barber!Tel's is very old-fashioned (in a good way) and all the barbers there are friendly, personable, and able to have a good chit-chat while you get your hair cut. Every time I've been to Tel's, they cut my hair EXACTLY how I want it which is pretty incredible. Compare this to other barbershops who cut your hair for the sake of cutting it, whether it comes out how you want it to or not. Tel's really cares about their customers, and I am confident I will get a quality haircut every time!"
8/27/15,0.233888889,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I just moved up to LA and was nervous about switching barbers. However Brian at tel's barbershop did a great job. I told him a very detailed haircut my previous barber would give me and he cut it up the same way. I will definitely be back. Thanks Brian!
1/8/13,-0.010454545,Negative,1,2.0 star rating,2,"You know how you can tell you got a bad haircut? When you got to work and no one says ""Oh, did you get a haircut?"" It's almost like everyone was worried about drawing attention to it.The other way you can tell is when the barber spends 5 minutes with a scissors and a buzzer and pronounces you done.  Really, the shortest cut I have ever had in my life.  I had the young guy, who seemed nice enough, but I didn't really get to find out because our conversation consisted of ""Hi"" ""How's things"" ""You're done""It's so strange, cause these guys are obviously so highly rated.  Maybe I just got the wrong guy.  Either way, won't come back, wouldn't recommend."
10/24/15,0.365909091,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"18yrs coming here...ALWAYS a great haircut, great chat with both the fellas and patrons, great periodicals while I wait and under-priced for what I get IMHO.  I'll empty my wallet to add a few bucks gratuity because it's worth every bit. Tel's is the best barbershop I've ever visited.  The only way to make it better is to serve drinks!  But then of course they'd never get a lot of us out of there...The Daily Pint is close by!I think I've written two Yelp reviews; I don't write this one lightly.Cash Only."
9/26/15,0.366666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I've been coming here for the last 5 years. Old school barber. They have always been great. They take the time and detail to get your hair the way you want. There's a reason why they are so busy and have been around for over 50 years. I've primarily been going to Randy and he does a great job everytime. Pro Tip: park across the street at the park so you don't have to worry about feeding the meters
5/20/16,0.313461538,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"We moved to SaMo 8 MLS. ago, & yet to find a genuine, not trendy, barbershop til today when my husband had his 1st appt. w/Brian.  He was so happy (& the wife/me:) also--Brian was friendly, welcoming, the shop is low-key & comfortable, & on top of that? He gave my husband a great haircut.  Not a fade (tho the younger guys were getting theirs), but a good-looking, done by a pro terrific hair cut.  The shop, Brian & the incredibly reasonable price were a breath of fresh air in a sometimes just 'too LA/SaMo' town.  Hesitated to write this, cause don't want the place getting too busy, but they deserve it."
9/14/16,0.317156863,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"My husband starting going here and my son asked me to have his hair cut at the same place.  I took my 13 year old to Tel's yesterday and he got a wonderful haircut.  He felt comfortable letting Tel (was his barber) exactly what he wanted; cleaned up on the side, not shaved and about 1/2 inch off the top.  He ended up with a nice clean haircut and felt like he was listened to with how he wanted it cut.  I will say that I do think they cut my husband's hair much better than other places and he doesn't look like he's about ready to go into the Army (they don't cut him too short :)  Great feel in this place, like an old-fashioned barber shop and I didn't feel like a silly mom waiting (I was made to feel welcome while I waited)."
5/18/15,0.232654672,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,"The Barber: Brian is the f*cking man. Super clean and super fresh fade, sharp lines and he'll even clean you up with the straight edge.The experience:I stumbled into this place by accident when I was trying to get to an appointment at the salon 2 doors down on Pico. When I went to my appt at the other place, the guy wasn't in yet and honestly I wanted to go back into Tel's just for the price I saw ($18). So I peaced the salon and went back to Tel's. Best deal in town. Super old school vibe-y shop, no bs and some down homies. Ended up with Brian by default and it was excellent- he knew exactly what I was looking for and did a great job- not to mention he's a great guy. Overall, great job on a pretty modern haircut. I'm usually skeptical of trying new places because they usually have their own variation on style, but Brian new exactly what to do with an old-fashioned cut and modern style. Thumbs up, gents."
6/16/16,0.057638889,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Moved to LA a little over a year ago and as soon as I found Tel's my search for a great haircut was over.  Tel, Brian, Andrew and Randy are awesome.  Price is impossible to beat and the wait isn't bad if you can sneak in weekday midday or early Sat."
11/28/14,0.096,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"I've been here 4 times now (most recently when my usual barbershop was closed for the day),and unfortunately it is very hit-or-miss.Each time I've had a different barber; 2 were very good and 2 were absolutely terrible.I have a very simple standard haircut (nothing more than clippers), and the latter two did a very poor job indeed.Unfortunately the bad experiences outweigh the good experiences, as is often the case, hence the 2 stars."
4/5/14,0.476041667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"great place to get a haircut for a ""reasonable"" price in the West LA area. price is $18/cut which is as good as itll get around here unless you want a crappy college haircut in Westwood. Ive had my hair cut by Tel and Randy and theyre both great guys. Real nice and try their best to get you the hair you want. After coming here for a while though I realized that Randy has a real good feel for what I like so I always wait to get cut by him now.Only complaint is that the wait can be loooong. Like you may wait over an hour to get your hair cut but hey, they're busy for a reason! Cheers to great local small businesses!"
6/27/15,0.525,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Been coming here for years. Randy, Tel and Brian are true pros. They will give you the cut you want, just the way you want it. Attention to detail, good conversation, just as it should be."

4/22/13,0.142490842,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"I've become a regular here. My hair is difficult and I am often indecisive on what I want. Generally, they do a great job listening and cutting it the way id like. They are not an upscale salon so my hair never really comes out looking ""trendy"", but they don't make mistakes and the price is right. Sometimes the older gentleman styles my hair at the end in a way like the pictures on the wall (you know, from the 50's...). It's nice of him, but I usually fix it by the time I get back to my car lol."
10/26/15,-0.032361111,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"Horrible. I went in to get a trim after growing my hair out for about a year as I wanted to change things up. I had told the barber I wanted to trim it down and make it shorter but not super short- just enough to the point where if I was to wear a hat, hair would be exposed in the back (about two inches below my ears I described). I showed him how long I wanted it by holding my hair up, and he cut it 5 inches SHORTER. he left me with about 2 inches in the front and top of my head, and about 6 inches in the back-- essentially a mullet. I am beyond angry and will never go back. These guys clearly don't cut ""hair"". Every other customer in there barely had hair on their head I don't know why they would even be in there. The only thing these barbers are good for is giving a buzz cut. If you actually have hair on your head I suggest going to a salon where people went to school on how to properly cut hair and make layers or anywhere else for that matter."

1/19/13,0.325,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This is THE best place on the westside to get a haircut. The 4 guys are all great, they give a quality cut and the price is fantastic. $16 for a cut (although you should give at least $20 inc tip) gets you EXACTLY what you ask for, not some young kid chopping how he thinks looks 'cool' which is what you get in some places.If you want a quality haircut, go here. Simple as that."
9/22/11,0.298333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Tel's is the best, forget the rest!!! There are three generations of barbers there and three generations of my family have been getting haircuts there.  I make sure I get there 1st thing in the AM in order to avoid the inevitable wait since they are super busy most of the time. You can call ahead and see how many people are waiting though, so you can get an idea of how long your wait will be.Tel's is the model that Pico, Lincoln barbers etc. try to achieve but there is only one old school barbershop in SM."
7/20/14,0.2,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,The most basic of haircuts. No real styling. I think I will go back to Floyd's for a more fashion forward result.  But this place is solid if you are in a need of a real quick one
1/12/13,0.122420635,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I arrived at Tel's this Saturday morning at 7:27am.  There was already one guy getting a haircut.  Two others were waiting.  Two minutes after me, two more guys came in.  Tel's opens at 8am on Saturdays.  These guys must be doing something right. Since moving to LA, I've been to Tel's for all but one last minute haircut I needed when Tel's was closed.  That one time I paid over twice as much and the cut didn't look half as good.These guys are the real deal.  And for $17/cut, the price is unfair... to them.  I hope everyone tips well.The wait usually sucks, but there's usually a wait because you get the best haircut in LA in for the lowest price.  Plus, these guys are really nice."

It's a classic barber shop and a good price. I like these guys and I hope they stay around forever.
4/15/10,0.336363636,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"This is a great old-fashioned family-run barber shop.  All the barbers do a great job because they care about what they are doing and they take their time to make sure that you're satisfied.  But on the flip side, that also means the wait for a haircut can be excruciating.  Since they don't take reservations, be prepared to wait over an hour when it's busy  Avoid Saturdays for this very reason.  Also, be sure to arrive at least 30 mins. before they close because they may lock the doors early if there are too many people waiting.Lastly, don't park your car in the public park's parking lot across the street.  It's a parking ticket death trap!"
10/10/13,0.252124669,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"If I could use an adjective to describe the barbers at Tel's it's that they're certainly experienced. All of the barbers here are mid aged and have been in the business longer than most of us have been alive. They have seen all of the fashion trends come and go. Getting a cut at Tel's was one of the best barber experiences I've ever had because my barber knew how to keep a conversation going with me. I loved how patient he was and how willing he was to give me input on what he personally thinks of the type of hairstyle I was pursuing. My conversations with the barber were honestly very therapeutic and after a long, stressful day; THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED! I just love how he took the time to make sure that all parts of my hair were cut in very fine detail. At the end of the massage I was greeted by a nice electronic shoulder massage. If you're in the Santa Monica area, this is a classic barber shop to check out. The only negative part about Tel's is that they don't offer straight razor shaves for facial hair! If you're looking for a shave of touch up on your facial hair I would recommend to check out Pico Barber's right down the street."
8/27/11,0.171994048,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"Just moved to LA from San Diego and was in need of a haircut for my sister's wedding later in the week. I was happy going to CeCi Salon in San Diego, so I was a little anxious finding someone up in LA. I decided to go to Tel's because of many wonderful Yelp reviews and the inexpensive price. As many have commented, the stylists are incredibly nice! A very pleasant experience. I feel terribly guilty for giving only 2 stars because they are so kind at Tel's. I am Asian with not-so-typical Asian hair, and I suppose this contributed to my less than satisfactory haircut.. I came out with one side of my hair uneven where the buzzer looks like it went a little too deep by accident.. I had asked for a trim of exactly how my hair was, but basically, my hair got turned into an 80's hi-top fade. Fortunately, a little home buzzing and some gel fixed it up decent. For my next haircut, I will likely pay the extra money to go to a stylist more familiar with Asian cuts."

Hard to believe this was the same person that everyone is giving 5 stars to...I would have to say this was likely the worst haircut of my life... There was about a 1/2 difference in length from right side to left side... Looked like a bowl cut, and my hair looked very messy each day after it dried from showering. I think a Flowbie(tm) would have done a better job.I just went to another stuylist to clean it up... Without saying anything about my dissatisfaction with Tel's job, the stylist looked stunned and asked ""You didn't have a friend cut your hair, did you?""Apparently, he has done a good job for others, but my haircut was truly lousy."

I was thinking of logging on and giving a 3.. maybe a 4.  When I got in, there were about 5 people waiting and it seemed to take forever to get to me.  I didn't like that they didn't take reservations and the neighborhood it was in had difficult metered parking.......Then I actually got my haircut.... 5 stars.... If i could give a 6 , it would be a 6.  The guy I had Andrew straight up knows how to cut hair.  I have asian hair (straight, grows out weird) so 99% of barbers I've been to have no idea how to cut it.  It always comes out different every single time.  I sat down and told Andrew that I literally got a haircut yesterday, but the barber butchered it..... within 10 minutes he literally gave me one of if not the best haircut I've ever had in my life.And are you serious?  For 16 bucks????  I gave him 25 and told him to keep the change and he seemed very grateful.  I basically told him I've paid $40 plus bucks at places that did not have the skill he had.When it comes down to GREAT looking hair and a GREAT cut.... 5 stars all the way.  Again.... the wait time was a little tedious (about 1 hour on a peak friday after work hour...) but no matter what the wait the haircut was worth it.  I will be coming back and asking for Andrew all the time."

4/7/11,0.047111111,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"I moved to Santa Monica from the South Bay where I have been living for 20 years. It was difficult for me to find a decent barber and so I was finding myself driving back to the South Bay every time I needed a hair cut. I found Tel's on Yelp and decided to give them a try. It was the BEST DECISION I made. Tel's is a family owned business with 3 generations working there with a lot of experience in cutting hair. The do a fantastic job with my hair cut, which is why they are my ""go to"" barber shop. The only down side is its location where you have to park on the street and pay meter parking. If you don't have any change the shop will provide you some. Also they don't take appointment so you might have to wait 20-25 minutes during the peak time. I highly recommend this place for a solid hair cut in Santa Monica."

It definitely was one of the best cuts I have received! Got what I asked for, some styling tips, a massage, and a straight razor shave on my neck. Now that's quality... even gave me some tips as to how to sharpen a straight and where to get them from. And the best part..the price! At the prices Tel asks for, I can actually AFFORD to come in once every month. Thanks Tel"

These guys know what they're doing, are the nicest and take the time to do things right.

The first cut I've had in a long time and it looks like I'll definitely be coming back. Thanks!"

I mean, a barber regardless of age, should know the ""styles"" of our modern era. Also, they don't wait for customers and close shop on the dot. $16 for a haircut? Smh..........I rather let the students at the local barber school jack my hair for $2."

Tel was the barber who cut my hair and he told me of his family who by the way are barbers too. It was a great story! Very old school and my hair came out very nice. Definitely a man's kind of barber. I found myself getting very comfortable in the chair and asked if I could get a shave. I was disappointed when Tel told me that they no longer gave the straight razor shave. A mandate came from the state saying that barbers had to wear rubber gloves during a shave. More BS from the state. Anyway, check this place out and enjoy the unrushed cut!!"

The barbers at Tel's are very accommodating to your needs and understand a good clean cut with clean lines. My son who is 10 yrs old always looks great after a cut here! Also, the barbers here know your name and make you feel at home. I promise, you go here and it will be your new barber shop for life! Thanks Tel's! P.S. This place has an old school register so bring cash. This place is how you would picture a real barber shop from the 50's. There is metered parking on the street so bring change too."

It's a nice family run shop and I've had haircuts by Tel himself. I used to park in the back in the abandoned lot and never had problems. The locksmith next door doesn't really mind if you walk through his store to get to Tel's.

Something that sounds so simple apparently baffles the majority of hair stylists and barbers in this city. He takes instruction very well and he's also a super friendly person. I feel like they really take their time here (total took me about an hour) so I wish they were open later than 5:15pm on weekdays since it's hard to get away from work in the middle of the day. Or maybe they could consider taking appointments. Otherwise, this place, like I said before, is solid."

It's located across from the park down by SBCC and there wasn't a wait when I walked in. Tel was my barber and, like others have pointed out, he really took his time cleaning up my head of hair: clippers, scissors, straight razor, and an unexpected shoulder/neck massage at the end. I didn't see that coming, but it actually felt pretty good. I'm glad a quality place like this still exists."

I get what one might think is a simple haircut: #3 all over. It always amazes me how many places screw this up. Not Tel's. The guy went over and over my head to insure there weren't any stragglers that he missed. The 1950's aftershave was a nice touch at the end. I went on a Friday morning and there was no line. Apparently Saturday and Tuesday are the busiest."

I discovered this place about 2 years ago and will continue getting my hair cut here as long as I live in LA. I used to go to a salon and was always annoyed when my stylist was late for my appointment then rushed me through. These guys at Tel's take their sweet time cutting your hair.  And I'm talking a short cut. They are perfectionists and the fact that so many people are willing to wait an hour or more to get in a chair is testament to this. There's no place like this."

If you are planning on getting a haircut here, plan on spending ATLEAST 30-60 min waiting.  In addition, it will take at least 30 min to cut your hair, even something totally basic. So in total you are spending over an hour on something that could take 15 min elsewhere.  Trust me - there is no such thing as a quick cut here.  If you are in a hurry, please go someplace else  - this place needs to realize that there is a world outside where time actually exists.  There have also been numerous times where I show up 30-60 min before their scheduled close and they have already shut and locked the doors.  In total, I would say that 1 out of every 3 times I go there, I don't even get my haircut because of these issues and its truly ridiculous.  The haircuts are just ok, no real complaints and at least they are pretty cheap. But I have to search for a new barber now because this place is just completely disappointing."

No one could compare to Ruben Morris off of Burlingame Avenue. Over the past 2+ years, I've been going to a high end, but high priced salon in Venice to get an even haircut and paying close to $60.Tels is the Barber Shop that I've been looking for since I got here. I went there this morning for the first time and got an incredibly great cut from Andrew (the youngest of the family). If his cut was this good, I can't imagine how good his grandfather, Tel's would be. $15 for the cut. Amazing taper, perfect shape and pretty much everything you would hope for from a classic barber shop. I will be coming here for as long as I live in LA. Thanks guys."
