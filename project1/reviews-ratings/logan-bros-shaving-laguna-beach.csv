2/14/18,0.051313131,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"I was exited to get my beard shape and trim at this place but the barber with full of tattoos  was a little rude, no personality at all, I asked him to shape my beard, he said trust me ! Well I did, and I end up with a fuck up beard that took me long time to growth, he gave me a scotch terrier look, with one mustache longer then the  other one. Ruined my haircut because he gave me a cholo lines on my sideburn. I had to have a new haircut and beard trim again. I don't understand why barbers in town has so poor attitude and skills.they act worse that a gay diva hair stylist ! Well at least those bitches made their job good. I will never come back to that place. If you are happy with number 1 at side and 3 on the top of your head that is the place for you."
1/21/18,0.15719697,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"The website states that each $30 haircut comes with a hot lathered-straight razor trip around the ears and back of the neck and any little extra that might need some attention (ears, eyebrows,). I came to treat my 13 year old son to that...a real barbershop experience. I was disappointed that it was not even mentioned. It was our first time here and based on reviews, I had wanted to bring him in for awhile. While I love the cut, perfect fade and so clean looking I feel $30 plus a $5 tip is pricey for a haircut."
8/20/17,0.440805785,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Visited Logan Bros with my family to get haircuts for the boys. My husband said it was the best cut and experience he had ever had and appreciated the time Nate took in detail. Kevin did a great job on my oldest son and was helpful in talking about the products he used. We have two little ones and the whole shop was kind and patient with all of us. The shop has a great vibe and great overall aesthetic. I would say we found our new favorite barber shop.
10/8/17,0.541666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Dropped by for a clean cut.  Met graciously by my barber and offered a drink. Great music on a Sunday and a better haircut. Kids and family enjoyed it.

5/21/17,0.161111111,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I have never given a yelp review in my life, but the cut Kevin gave me was worth the praise.I've been to every shop in OC basically in my two years of living down here, and I'm glad I finally found someone who knew what they were doing. Go out of your way to get a cut from him, you won't regret it....also the shop is immaculate and location is 10/10"
3/18/17,0.322222222,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I took my one year old for his first haircut. Kevin  is fantastic! He had a lot patience and great hair cutting skills. He also has great shop talk. He did great job with my son. After I got a head shave and a hot towel shave. I would definitely recommend this place and Kevin to cut ur hair.
8/4/17,0.17630854,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Was needing a haircut badly and walked into Logan Bros. Kevin was fantastic. Suggested parting my hair a different way because the hair laid better. Gave me a fresh new haircut and new look. Love it. Look younger and feel fresh and clean. Thank you Kevin. If in town, go in with confidence to get your hair cut well."
7/1/17,0.335714286,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"My son loves barbers since a kid we have been traveling around getting our hair cut. Today we had a great day with Nate ""the broken hand barber"" great fade and cut on my son.  But his terrible boxing skills prevented him from using the straight blade.  So mark "" the magician"". Stepped in for strait blade magic.    Both great barbers and your in for a great quality cut.  Sports clips is . This place is the ticket for a great day outing with your son . You can grab a cold brew and enjoy.    Big shout out to Nate and Mark.  Mark is now called the magician because I watch him transform jaba the hut into a backstreet boy.    Great day , great hair barbershop ."

8/16/16,-0.083942446,Negative,1,3.0 star rating,3,"I wanted to love this place. Really.The space is cool, the guys are fun, the beer is free. Feels like you've stepped into a better time in a better place. Oh, they also gave my son one hell of a haircut. He looked terrific.So, the problem: the shave.This wasn't just a bad shave. This was a bloody, painful, terrible shave. Left with deep cuts in my face. And, weirdly, stubble. Seriously, it would be disappointing enough if the guy just cut me. But that happens. In this case, he cut me (a lot) while shaving me (not so much). Weird, right? I went home and... shaved. That can't be good.In their defense, it was actually the second time I've gone in for a hot towel shave. The first time, aces. The barber knew his stuff, cleaned me up, and kept me laughing. Really a terrific experience.This time, though, the poor guy was just... bizarrely new to shaving. And that's not great.I don't shave myself with a straight razor because a) I'd do a terrible job and b) I'd leave myself a bloody mess. Hard to justify paying $35 to have a stranger do the same. Also, mildly terrifying.It really is a sign of just how much I liked these guys that I'm giving three stars. I mean, I'm giving three freakin' stars to a dude who drew blood with a straight razor. That's one REALLY nice guy. Hoping just maybe they'll see this and let the shaving superstars do the shaving and the stylists cut hair. Maybe? Less dangerous for all.Shave on."
1/23/17,0.675,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Great shop with good service and modern cuts. Took my boy there and the guys where awesome
6/5/17,0.1,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Logan Bros know how to give a quality cut and shave. The precision and detail given to my straight razor shave was second to none.
2/9/17,0.9,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,Their haircut got me a promotion. It almost got me a three way but it still got me a promotion so it's still real good. They feed you beers. It is the best. Man with tattoos on head is good at making hair cuts.
4/19/17,0.327272727,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I don't live in the area anymore, but started coming to these guys when I come to visit.  Great haircuts even when you're not a regular.  Also a fun atmosphere with free drinks and tunes/movies."
12/18/16,0.27288961,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"Nate & Kevin are both great.  Both my husband and 4 yr old enjoy coming in to get their hair cut. We actually feel more welcome at this location than the one in Aliso.  They are family friendly (yes, even with the large cooler of beverages in the back).  The only reason I docked 1 star is that I think they are a little pricey."
12/28/16,0.42,Positive,0,4.0 star rating,4,"Just had a cut and shave there today. Great experience all around. I would definitely recommend this shop to anyone looking for a chill time in barber's chair. You get a drink while you sit, a good chat, and a great shave and trim.  Kevin killed it on the shave and the friendliness."
9/6/17,0.532,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Great barbershop. Old school feel and great talent. Kevin is a great barber and conversationalist. I highly recommend him.
2/28/17,-0.0890625,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,Best barber shop in laguna beach.. Every person that works there will never do you wrong. Ive had some bad haircut experiences but none have been here their music is always on point and ive nevwr had to set an appointment online like other places. Just walk in! Never had to wait either
12/29/16,0.421875,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Love the guys! So friendly and do a great job! No better place to get haircuts for my boys!
12/10/16,0.42037037,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Great barber shop with a chill vibe.  Walked in on a Saturday and jumped in a chair pretty quick.  Kevin has great skill and really appreciate his attention to detail and his level of service.   Net is, great cut, great service.... killed it."
12/1/16,0.158333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Came in late for a hot towel straight blade shave and Mark did a great job. I will definitely come back again for a shave.
5/8/17,0.136011905,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I'm really picky about who I let touch my hair and these guys knock it out of the park. I was going to strictly Aveda salons for years before getting the recommendation to go here upon moving to Laguna Beach. I've started regularly having Mark cut my hair. I definitely recommend going to him if you like tight skin fades and anything done with a straight razor. Everybody needs a good barber. Can't beat finding one in a classic atmosphere next to the water.
12/8/16,0.463541667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"My husband goes here for a cut and shave, and he loves it! I've accompanied him there a few times and love it too! The environment is wonderful and the people are fantastic! Kevin is super talented as are all of the guys there. I highly recommend this barber shop!! Also the dollar signs on this review should be $$ not four. Hope someone changes that :-)"
7/3/17,0.259944444,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I came down yesterday My barber was Jayden. He was quiet but still talked to me. he did my hair amazing I got exactly what I wanted. He is forsure my go to guy from now on. I usually don't write reviews but my hair came out so nice! Thank you Jayden , you guys should come to this place and ask for him or even to the other guys as well. The shop is very nice and has a cool surf shop in it too. They also gave me a free beer with my cut and shave"
11/16/16,0.171487603,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Love the new barber shop in town. They are so easy to work with. First time I went, they had just closed up five minutes earlier (must have been 7:05) and were cleaning up. Kevin offered to give me a haircut anyway. I have had four more haircuts since then, and every time it is quick and easy. It definitely helps when they give me an ice cold Modelo"
5/7/17,0.645546875,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,The atmosphere is warm and friendly and Kevin and Mark were a pleasure to chat with.  My son Matthew got a wonderful haircut from Kevin.  Kevin is very talented and took the time to make sure that the cut was exactly what my son wanted.  A+ service!!!
11/1/16,-0.2,Negative,1,2.0 star rating,2,They charge $10 extra to make an appointment and claim to have a line if you just drop in? not a great attitude/ customer service starter.

7/27/16,0.4875,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,"This place is a great place to get a haircut, shave, and a free beer to boot.  Caleb is a master; he really made me look my best.  He was careful and takes great pride in his work.  The prices are reasonable too!   If you're a guy in Laguna Beach or the environs,I can't imagine why you'd go anywhere else!"
