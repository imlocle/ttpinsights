2/20/18,-0.102777778,Negative,1,5.0 star rating,5,Thanks to active barbers my boyfriend is always looking fresh and clean he's been going with Steve for four years now and he's never seen anyone else. They always accommodate his crazy work schedule and the ambience is always dope. Stop by you won't be disappointed.

3/3/18,0.047135417,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"Used to be a great haircut spot but has been getting progressively worse and worse. The barbers began caring less about doing a good job. They always charge me different prices for doing the same thing. My buddy went in the other day and got charged $30 just for getting his beard lined up - the cost was supposed to be $15! Anyway, just my two cents."
3/17/18,0.184027778,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Best place to get your hair cut on the west side. Chris usually gets my hair, and I haven't found anyone that can do a better taper. Come here. $30 is a little on the pricey side, but compared to some of the other places on the west side, that's a decent price."
4/11/17,-0.144602273,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"I came here with a friend after looking through yelp and was repeatedly disappointed. To begin, parking is extremely difficult with no public parking available for customers. As we were waiting for the two male barbers, we discovered a sign that said ""Cash Only"" and had to leave the property to withdraw cash at a nearby bank. Upon waiting 30 min (there are only 2 barbers working at a time), I explained to my barber the type of cut I wanted and even provided multiple photos at different profiled angles to help. I could tell he wasn't even listening and he immediately began shaving my head without even fading the sides like I asked him too. I sat there in utter shock and I continually glanced at him through the mirror to find him only focused on watching the television in front of him. I even specifically told him of the direction of my calic before the cut and he ended up cutting it in the wrong direction!! He also gave me a horrible line-up all along my head, which I didn't ask for, and had a rash for several days afterwards. In the head my head was practically bald on the sides and the back and a whole lot of hair sprouting on the top of my head aka. I still tipped the man because I just can't get myself to leave no tip regardless of how much I like the cut. He provided me with a service so I still tipped him $5 but overall, I am extremely disappointed in the minimal effort and lack of attention given to me and my friend by this establishment. I have uploaded a photo onto this yelp page for proof that this shop doesn't understand what a comb-over fade is. Would not recommend x5"

12/28/17,0.211111111,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"This place is a joke. Napoleon thinks he's a genius and a master at cutting hair and just goes to town doing whatever he thinks is best. Not once listening to the customer or asking any questions. By the end of the cut I realize he nearly shaved my entire head off with a buzz cut and says ""best haircut you ever got"". HA, please. Charges $30 for haircut and only accepts cash. No thanks - find some place better where they actually listen to what you want."
2/3/18,0.170833333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"First time at a barber shop and I am definitely glad I stopped by. I was tired of the same hairstyle for the past 18 years so i stopped by at Active Barbers and I do not regret it one bit. I went in and just said ""do whatever you want"" and luckily my man Napoleon knew exactly what to do. He gave me a perfect taper fade and left some on the top for me to work with. I recommend this place to anyone in need of a cut. And will definitely be back soon. Shout out to Napoleon!"

1/8/18,0.255357143,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,"Came here for a haircut and a beard trim while visiting LA for the holidays.  I got a great cut and my beard was carefully trimmed, and I only paid around $40.  The barbers were very friendly and it was fun to listen to their banter.  This feels like a ""guy's place,"" fun, no nonsense.  Will be back."
12/28/17,0.412045455,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Best cut I ever had. After a lifetime of begging barbers to use their judgement and make me look good, I finally found the place. Very intimate, energetic environment. The guy cut my hair in a way that gave me a whole new look and made me feel better about myself."
4/2/17,0.075,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,Came in for a haircut and sat in the small waiting area for 45 min and no one cared that I was sitting there.... the barbers kept cutting and yapping away and not caring the line was getting longer and longer. People don't have all day to wait and sit and the people here need to do a better job of understanding this and get people in and out faster...As for the cut. It's totally not worth the $30. They on two occasions messes my cut up after sitting and being ignored. It does not take 45 min for a haircut and people don't have all day to wait and be ignored Come here if you want to be ignored and made to feel like a patient in a doctors office.  It's a complete turn off. The atmosphere as well as the barbers. Once they learn how to have proper customer service and understand people have things to do and a life and offer me a free haircut I will be back.They also play offensive things on the TV that is not appropriate for children and more appropriate for the hood. This is Wilshire Blvd.

Day 1, he really took his time to make sure I got the haircut I exactly wanted or similar from back home. Needless to say I've been coming to him to get my cut since that day! He's a pleasure to talk to, easy going and a real good guy."

1/12/18,0,Negative,1,2.0 star rating,2,"I wanted a cheaper barber, and got a cheap-looking cut. If your hairstyle is very simple and generic - these guys will hook you up, but if you have preferences, if you are trying to explain something - forget about it, you will walk out with a generic haircut."

1/9/18,0.425,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Steven, Rob, and the entire crew are the best barbers in LA. It's difficult to find a spot where each barber will give you a perfect fade. These guys are true professionals and have built a name for themselves for good reason."
7/25/17,0.118831169,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,Go somewhere else if you aren't already a regular. Used to be wonderful but I hadn't brought my kid in for a while and we were treated like shit when we tried to come back. So rude and inconsiderate. Steven knows my kid has special needs and HATES haircuts but we were still made to wait an hour after being skipped for a regular customer that came in after us. I sat and watched the most involved freaking fade in the world for 30 minutes before I got up and walked out. Really disappointed that my effort to support a young entrepreneur backfired so spectacularly. Won't make that mistake again.
1/25/17,0.451664371,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Walked in on advice of a friend. I wasn't really sure what I wanted. I just new I need a good fade and fresh look. I sat down and told Luis I trusted him. At first he was hesitant .. I assured him I knew he was a pro. ""Do what you think is best"". He took his Time gave my hair so much detail... Honestly this might be one of my best hair cuts ever!If you are in Santa Monica. And Need a hair cut stop in talk to. Luis or  Saul true professionals!"

8/16/17,0.32,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I took my friend here to get his hair cut because it was nearby and it was a great shop. They have flexible hours and the wait wasn't bad. Most importantly Louis did a really nice job on his hair~

5/10/17,-0.0125,Negative,1,2.5 star rating,2,Not completely what they're cracked up to be. I got my hair cut by Fez. I asked for a low fade on the sides with a taper finish and a crop.  He didn't deliver much on the fade and the crop was completely uneven.
8/11/17,0.41175,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"My little brother got a hair cut and I called before going into the Barber shop and we had looked at the yelp reviews before going in to see the amount of time it would take. They have good service and give you the best quality hair cuts you can get.My brother asked for a design on his head and we showed Robert the photo and completed the design very well and my brother loved it and still continues to get his hair cut from there.The barbers Robert,Chris ,and Steven are very enthusiastic people and will put all their effort to cutting your hair.The Barber shop is a very thrilling  place. I suggest this place for people to come here for an amazing cut and an amazing time."

3/22/17,0.282638889,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"If you are in the market for a good haircut, I recommend Chris at Active Barbers.  My hair has been a bit out of control the last week, and I saw a barber shop place in Santa Monica.  I was a regular customer over a Floyd's and mostly happy with the cuts their.  Whelp, that was before my latest cut from Chris.  He gave me a 1 1/2 inch fade with 2 1/2 on top.  This was significantly shorter than how I usually wear it.  But, I trusted him.  And, I left looking mighty stylish."
7/19/16,-0.11204844,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"** If you want a useful review, read this one **I used to come here all the time, and would recommend to friends in the area who wanted a good barber. Certainly not anymore, I tell all my friends to AVOID!If you call ahead and get Rob you're fine. But I'd rather have my little brother cut my hair than go to any of the walk in people. Rob, if you read this and care about your business, get your people trained and tell them to have pride in their work. Now for some examples...It literally feels like they're racing against each other for fastest haircut. In fact, they have even made comments about time and setting records while I've been there. I understand you may get bored, but you're not making pizzas. We are paying for 'higher quality' haircuts. I feel like an experiment when every time I walk in there these days. One of the shorter fat kids, I don't think it was Mondo, is by far the worst. I was shocked at how rude he was, like I was asking for a favor by coming in for a cut. He started cutting my hair mid sentence of describing what I wanted, and was finished about 5 minutes later. Didn't say a single word when I paid or reluctantly tipped him. Still regret that part. This isn't the DMV dude, seriously I would fire you if it was my shop. You suck. Overall this place is more of an offensive Hair Cuttery staffed with people who could care less what your cut looks like or if you return. I would even go to Floyds over them, or maybe just close my eyes and do it myself. My guess is that Rob does care, I'm assuming he owns the place. Dude, I know they're your friends but I would fire everyone and start clean. This place was fire a year ago. I dont know what happened, but it is so terrible now. Have some pride in your work or you wont go far.** Edit: After writing this it made me more upset, wish I could give negative stars. Not worthy of anything above zero.** Edit 2:Still mad. Still sucks. Do what you were doing a year ago. Can't wait to go somewhere else."

5/2/17,0.4,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Rob and Steven always know how to hook it up with an urban cut. Fresh on the top and fade on the sides is there specialty. Also always have a great time at there bar Padrino's in Lawndale
2/24/17,0.45,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Best barber shop in LA. Really friendly and fun atmosphere, great place to spend an hour. These guys are hilarious and know how to welcome you into their barbershop community. Rob, the owner, even gave me a beer when he found out it was my birthday. Plus they do incredible fades. I'm personally partial to Jasmine, but I've gotten my hair cut by 4 or 5 other people and they've all been fantastic. I've been coming here for nearly 2 years now and I won't stop unless they make me."
8/10/17,0.238095238,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,Make sure you make an appointment before coming to this barber shop. The wait time can be over an hour without warning. Only two of the barbers take walk ins on certain days and they don't even warn you before you visit here
2/23/17,-1,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,I paid $50 and got worst haircut.Dont even think to go there at all and they dont care how they did their job.
4/10/17,0.266666667,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,I went to Active Barber Shop on Saturday and got a bald fade with a design from Sal. The fade was flawless and the design was on point. I would totally go back if I'm back in the area. I recommend this shop for anyone that gets urban cuts like fades and tapers. Price is 30$ but it is worth it I promise. Ask for Sal he is a good barber and he has been at it for years.
7/9/16,0.299600168,Positive,0,4.5 star rating,4.5,"Super legit barber shop.  Came in and got a stunning cut and beard shape up from Jasmine.  Looks like all of the folks here really know what they are doing.  They have that classic barber rhythm and flavor.  Small shop, but they really take care of you.  They even finish you off with a quick (but awesome) neck massage.  Definitely my new spot!!"
4/29/17,0.301245791,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Best barber shop in LA! Been going there for a year now and I always leave happy. I just sit down and tell Steven that I trust him to go for it.

5/14/15,0.013095238,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,"I'd have to give this place a 3 prob would've been lower but I'm a nice guy. I waited over an hour that's no problem. But the cut was not worth it.  He initially cuts my hair totally different than what I asked for had to ask him to fix it. So he cuts it better but one side of the fade was lighter than the other big no no! My hairline was taken back after I tried to explain to him that I didn't want it taken back any. I asked for my beard to be lined up a certain way and also part of my beard to be trimmed, both were to little avail. He lined the top of my beard different than I asked after multiple explanations still wrong and I never got the part trimmed that I asked for. I left because I didn't want to keep asking him to fix things. Didn't offer to clean my neck which was really hairy. I think I'm gonna lower this rating as I'm writing this I'm actually getting upset.With all of that said those things weren't the worst part. I paid $25 for a cut not worthy and I broke out on my face. I'm not sure what he used to shave me with but I have many little  bumps on my face."
4/18/16,0.073376623,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Robs been cutting my hair for almost 7 years now and I don't think it's gonna change anytime soon. I have such a hard haircut because of scars and two cowlicks but he kills it everytime even when I don't go in for months at a time cause I wanna grow it out but get tired half way through and cut it. (Hobo special) but the end result is always the same. Clean lines and great taper. He also does my beard to perfection everytime. The place is clean and friendly staff this will be my barber forever....
2/16/17,0.416459517,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Went in to get a cut......Barber sal cut my hair I was really satisfied with my cut it was done jus the way I wanted it ....He is my #1 barber from now on.....I live in LA and I drive 45 min jus to get cut buy him!!!!
3/18/16,0.067685185,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,So I gave this place a try due to the high yelp reviews. I was hoping to get a decent haircut for the price they were asking but the person who cut my hair doesn't know how to cut hair at all. I was surprised they were using such dull blades to cut hair that it felt very akward. I have so many uneven areas due to that especially in the back and I'm even missing a chunk of hair back there. The barber doesn't know what their doing especially with the front of my hair that I cant even do a comb over that my hair normally is able to do easily. I will never waste my money on here again.
1/19/17,0.289090909,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Place has good vibes from the minute you walk in. Music was good, people were friendly, and the shop was spotless. They even have aprons with cell phone covers so you can use your phone while getting cut without the hair everywhere. The price was $30 but you get what you pay for. Robert took his time and had my beard and taper on point. They're wrong about taking Pittsburgh over New England this weekend though!"
3/28/15,0.234848485,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"There are more than a few barbers here, I haven't had the privilege of getting a cut by Steven?(owner) but Megan (blonde girl) is exceptional. Being an asian dude who used to cut hair, I am picky and know exactly what I want. Also, asian hair isn't the easiest to do a clean fade on. In short, I haven't seen a lady barber as talented as Megan. If you want the fresh cut with a feminine touch, Megan is the way to go."
10/30/16,0.241666667,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,Only okay. Rob seem to be the only talented barber at this small shop. And at $40 ( including a $5 tip) you would expect more talent at this stricly no-frills barber shop.
6/28/17,0.356666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I took my son here and he got the best haircut of his life. He saw Robert but my friends husband and sons see anyone who is available and they highly recommended active barbers to me.

8/8/16,0.353030303,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Active Barbers is a great hip spot. Robert and Steven are hardworking and talented barbers. You could go to a top Beverly Hills salon $$ and not get the quality cut that they provide. The atmosphere inside is like their namesake, Active. They are warm and courteous to all that walk in. The greatest thing I admire about them is that they are living the American Dream. They started at the bottom and now are owners of their own business. Hard work and perseverance is the road map to success. I always get a great cut, even if ROBERT can't cut me. Jasmine, Chris, mondo give great cuts as well. Best thing after cut is they give an old fashioned massage with hand held massager. Classic barber shop that's cool and professional. Keep up the hard work and drive. It is appreciated. Big Mike"

Really bad haircut and didn't give what I asked for at all."
5/29/17,0.075,Positive,0,2 star rating,2,"I've had a cut from almost every barber in here except Steven and honestly if it wasn't for Rob I would give this place zero stars. I rarely complain and I never give yelp reviews, but please, if you want your money's worth and then some, don't go for anyone else but Rob. I feel bad for giving the place 2 stars just because of how skillful Rob is, but if you are going to charge $30 for a cut, at least find barbers that are willing to put in the work."
9/26/16,0.095558608,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Overall, just a great experience. They gave me the cut I needed and did it fast. They also use some turbo air blower to remove any loose strands so you leave not feeling like you need to run home and jump in the shower. It could have been a little less loud."
8/1/16,0.083901515,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,"My husband has been here a few times for his haircuts. Originally the fades were good (even though they are on the higher side of price) However, some of the newer barbers there are not great. The worst part (this is mainly my reason for 3 star) is that the last two times he has been there and I have waited for him, the haircuts lated more then one hour !! (That is crazy!) and even after that, the cut was sub par at best."
7/25/15,0.089146568,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,"Advice: Make an appointment or only go to Chris or Megan you do Walk in. Also Haircuts go up to $30 starting September 1st.I thought I would never give this spot less than 4 let alone 5 stars. I've been getting my haircut here for almost a year now. I only do walk in's because Chris and Megan, I think that's her name, has always done a great job. They took pride in their cuts and always made sure everyone left with a fresh cut. That being said, the two newest guys just don't seem to grasp that concept. You know I figured All the Barbers here are dope, so these guys should be cool. Nope. They don't seem to follow directions well,  f your hair up and look at you and almost say ""that's what you asked for, pay and leave."" At least try to make my shit look decent, I got patches of hair sticking straight up right where I part it and lines all crooked like a politician. The newest guy at least has a good attitude, he is new, but he still f my shit up. The short stocky cat...bad attitude and worse hair cuts."

ACTIVE BARBERS is the place I recommend for you and everyone else! After trying out a lot of barbers, I was referred to Steven by my older brother. Finally found someone who just knows the type of hair cut I wanted, most importantly how clean it looks at the end. Tell him what you want and he'll hook you right up! Not only do I recommend Steven, But also all the other barbers there. All the barbers there are friendly and know how to hook you up! Go give them a shot, and best believe you'll leave there with a clean cut!"

Last haircut is going to be my last, however, due to the inconsistency in haircuts between barbers. Can't support a place that charges top dollar for a cut that looks great sometimes but sometimes looks like I buzzed it myself."

I feel welcomed every time and the staff is always super friendly and kind . It's super clean and smells amazing, but it's also a small barber shop as it should be... Oh plus they have three plasma TVs so you can watch some sports while you get a fresh cut. My usual barber Chris ( he's the one with the awesome mustache) always knows what I want so there's  not much of the worried feeling wether or not I'm getting what I want . Also the rest of the barbers there are super skilled  . So basically what I'm trying to say is that this barber shop is simply amazing. They don't try to be something they're not, it's a straight and to the point barber shop. Reasonable prices for Men's haircuts and it's great for kids too. Oh and if you go ask for Chris !!!!!"

She takes soooo much pride in her work and absolutely loves what she does so all the props to her. The rest of the guys are cool they have good banter and it's well priced for the area.So why four stars instead of five? last time I went a couple of Saturday's ago, I got seen by another guy (new as I hadn't seen him before) and he was just chilling in the barbers chair without his uniform on, so I didn't even realize he worked there till he called me over. Now I usually will not get seen by anyone else but Megan (and I have waited over an hour on walk ins just for her to do my hair). But I was in desperate need of a cut, she wasn't in that Saturday and this guy was the only one available so I was just like whatever. Lesson learnt - stick with what you know and who you're comfortable with. And make an appointment as the wait is long. Knocked off a star as this dude didn't do a good job on my hair at all (and I am incredibly particular about the style) and was left with bumps along my hairline, no clean up the back of my neck and the front of my hair was just a mess. Will get back to Megan to get it fixed."

This place isn't for me because I waited an hour to get a haircut because the barbers worked slowly. Now, I understand that sometimes it takes some time to get things right, but I have seen barbers work faster and not taking 40 minutes per a person on something that is basic. Anyways, I waited because I NEEDED a hair cut for a job interview that was soon. After the 55 minute wait, I had to go back to my car to add more time to the machine, and when I came back, they had just BARELY skipped me. The barber that did it acted like nothing, didn't apologize. I was so livid. This was my first time coming here and never again will I come back. Granted they probably do give great hair cuts, I just couldn't afford to wait anymore.Now here I am about to go to my interview looking like Mogli from jungle book. Extremely upset. I'll tell my friends to not come here."

Open early, even on weekends, so you can get your haircut and go about your day. All the barbers here are talented, thorough, and professional. I see Jasmine, who always gives me a clean cut and lines me up perfectly. Even after the first time seeing her, she remembered how I like my hair cut, so I don't even have to ask. Love this place."

Instructions were disregarded and what I got reminded me of how my mother cut my hair when I was a kid, except that even my mother was capable of making an even line across the forehead.Later in the day my fiancee reached for my forehead and said ""there's a hair on your forehead."" After three failed grasps, she said sheepishly ""never mind. I think it's attached to your head."" Yes, this barber managed to leave a single goddamn orphan hair half an inch away from all the others.Holy crap, what a travesty."

There's a certain barber here that didn't pay attention while cutting my hair (watching tv), didn't listen well (cut it differently than what I asked), and argued with me when I tried to tell him he did something wrong. I've even experienced him doing it to other customers!!! Wth. Oh and when my neck was shaved, no shaving cream was used and I didn't get any tonic afterwards -- shit was burning for a few hours. Don't know his name but if you come here I wouldn't be surprised if you knew who I was talking about...HOWEVER...that was one experience and I actually feel that many barbers that work here aren't like that, and they do a great job, and so I'm sticking to giving this place 5 stars.With that being said, you're probably better off making an appointment. I don't know everyone's names but Robert does amazing work, it seems like he has many years of experience cause he just whips them out like they're nothing. He's very quick and very personable. Prices are very reasonable considering the area; 20$ for a haircut. Cash only, but there's a Wells Fargo across the street for those who bank with them.  Anyway, that about sums it up. Check it out!"

I've had various barbers work on me and various styles since coming here, and everything has exceeded my expectations. When you come here you get lined up with a straight edge (as it should be), and cleaned off with compressed air so you're not covered in hair driving home or going wherever you need to be. Definitely recommend this place if you're reading these reviews. You will be taken care of and whatever style you're looking for you'll get. They also have TV's and good convos going on while waiting so the wait is never dull. Props to Rob for always taking care of me when I come in."

I went to many different places and couldn't find anyone that I felt did a consistent good job. So much so, that sometimes I would wait until I went back to San Diego to get a haircut. A couple months ago I got my hair cut by Steven and I haven't looked back. He always takes his time and delivers a great hair cut. They even open super early in the morning for those that might not be able to make it in the afternoon. I usually get my haircuts before 7am and it works great (make an appointment).I've never had a bad experience here. A couple weeks ago Steven handled an appointment mix-up very well. Unfortunately, there was a misunderstanding about the time that I made the appointment (AM vs PM) and there was already someone getting a haircut when I came in at 6:30am. He apologized and without me asking for anything he gave me a free haircut. Now that's customer service! I definitely recommend trying this place out if you're looking for a top quality barbershop."

The shop has a bunch of really good barbers, over the last months I got my cuts from Meagan, Chris, Robert, and Steven and I left the store with a very clean cut every time (even though I have to say I liked Steven's cut the last time as my haircut before my wedding the best)! I'm not the guy that is looking for a buzz cut but more like a blend of short in the back and on the sides and longer at the top. They got it right every single time!The vibe is easy, the prices are great and as I said, all barbers are very good and super nice!Steven told me the last time that they are investing in a central AC unit to keep it nice and cool during the hotter days, I never felt too warm though. There is plenty of street parking available. I recommend to come weekdays in the morning if you don't feel like waiting!As I said, go check them out, you won't be disappointed!"

I should have paid more attention to the negative ones as those are the ones that are accurate. Terrible haircut with people that obviously don't have experience. They just talked about how much they drank last night and seemed as if they weren't paying attention to what they were doing. The end result definitely showed. They didn't listen to what I wanted and asked for. At the end, they showed me the back and it was very uneven. When asked to fix it, I was more afraid that it would be worse. Definitely will never come back here. I wish I had gone to supercuts."

It's a small shop where the barbers and customers make it feel like you're just hanging out at a friends house. Steven even gave me an ice-cold Beer, that's the name of it, quite a tasty one too. On top of that I had Steven trim my beard, for an extra $5 on top of the $20 haircut. Never had that done before. Came out of the place looking as fresh as I've ever been after leaving a barber. HIGHLY recommend this place. You won't be disappointed. Cheap place with an actual great haircut and great service. Well done. Place rules."
5/28/14,0.218345796,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I started getting my cut by Steven way back in 2010 when he was at a dinky barber shop. Look at him now with his own place and a massive following!Two barbers started here and I think they're up to four now. Steven, of course, is the best, but the other guys are damn good, too (I know two of them from the prior barber place as well). Steven wouldn't let them be here if they weren't good. Steven's standards are absolutely meticulous. Check out the pictures on Yelp or Instagram to see for yourself. Whether you're young and hip or old and simple like me, he's got your back (and your clean bare-razor-shaven neck). He hand-selected the chairs and the furniture. These are authentic, old-school, heavy ass barber chairs. You may not appreciate that level of detail, but your style will.I'll mention one bad point that I've mentioned before. The more experienced guys are popular, so you should try your best to make an appointment. They do take walk-ins, though.Active Barbers is located on Wilshire Blvd, between 25th and 26th. It is right next to the Starbucks on Wilshire and 26th. There is plenty of metered parking on Wilshire and 25th. I've been many times and haven't had much trouble finding parking. There are a couple of spots in the back, but I don't think the signs were up last time I checked.Between the dinky place and Active Barbers, Steven was at Lincoln Barbers, at both locations in Santa Monica, where I had gotten to know the other guys as well (who are also good). So a here is shout-out to them, but I'll obviously have to be partial to the new place now."

He has turned my comb over pomp into a beauty that I can only be happy with. My beard is finally being shaped correctly and he makes sure to get it perfect every time.

Everyone that was getting a haircut seemed very happy with the results on their cut. Highly recommend this barbershop. They all take pride in the craft with that being said the quality is high. Very friendly environment with great energy.

7/20/14,0.076788897,Positive,0,2.0 star rating,2,"I don't write reviews at all, but after trying out Active Barbers, I need to say something.The barbers I usually go to at Capsule Barbershop were out of town or busy, so I decided to hit up some place new. I check Yelp and read all the great reviews and saw all the 5 stars on Active Barbers, so I hit em up and asked for mid-fade combover and got one of the worst cuts I've ever had since middle school.The barbers here are nice and they have nice clippers and equipment but don't let that fool you. They really don't know how to cut hair besides a simple buzzcut which anyone can really do. It's not worth the trip or money to come here; I'm already getting an appointment with my usual barber to fix the butchered cut that I got here. Like seriously...everything was uneven, it wasn't even a fade, and the barber wasn't even holding the clippers the right way.If you're looking for a good place to get a cut, look someplace else."
10/13/14,-0.044040179,Negative,1,1.0 star rating,1,"Worst haircut I've had in a very long time!!  One side by my temple got completely missed but the other side didn't, so the difference is obvious as soon as you look at me.  There are places that are long and others that are short pretty much all over my head. The only mirror is on the opposite side of the room so you can't really tell what is happening. The guy handed me a mirrorat the end and asked me to see what I thought.  With a mirror in one hand you can't really do a very good job of checking the haircut. He didn't even comb or attempt to style my hair before taking the bib off, taking my money and sending me on my way. I trusted that he knew what he was doing until I got in my car and began to notice what an awful hack job he had done to my hair. NEVER AGAIN!!"
3/14/15,0.7,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Great place for a haircut. The guys are nice and do a great job. I walked in with a picture of a hair style that I liked and they had no problem with it. Will come again
3/9/16,0.019798636,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I've been going to active for about a year and half now and have gotten my hair cut by pretty much everyone there.Most recently mainly gill but if Chris has an opening I would preferably take that. When I went in today I was a lil hesitant because neither of the chicks working I recognized but because today's my new day off I sat down on got my usual skin tight taper into a 1 on side 2 on top with w/ a beard clean up. The chick jasmine hooked my shit up... Probably one of the cleanest cuts I've gotten at active.... She took her time and blended my beard better than I've ever had done. Over all active is the shit. I've strayed off the path twice and went to floyds and Eddie v's looking for 20$ cut when actives price went up and all I got was some fucked up fade and felt like an asshole for a week because I was to embarrassed to walk into active to get it fixed. At the end of the day you get what you pay for.... I strongly recommend active. Don't really matter who cuts your hair they all are dope.

Got my cut 2 weeks ago and it was by far the best haircut I've gotten so far. His fades are on point and he listens to what you want and always leaves you satisfied with the cut you asked for. If you're looking for a great cut at a great price check out active barbers! I live in sherman oaks and I make the drive over the hill for this shop, its worth it."
6/18/14,0.215598291,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"There are four barbers here: Steven/Robert who take appointments and Chris/Gabe who take care of walk-ins. I came in on a Friday after work, waited about 15 minutes and got my hair cut by Gabe. I'm pretty sure all of them know how to give fresh cuts, but I can only comment on Gabe's work.I wasn't sure what I wanted so I just asked for tapered sides and let him do his thing. I was not disappointed. Hands down one of the cleanest cuts I have ever gotten. He was quick, detailed and had a lot of knowledge. Overall, it was well worth the $20. I'm definitely going to be coming back to this place and recommending it to my buddies who need a barber."

I make the drive from Arleta to Santa Monica every Saturday for a cut. He does excellent work and is patient when I can't make up my mind on the length of my hair. Rob and Steve are also cool they give the shop a laid back, friendly atmosphere. I highly recommend Chris and Active Barbers."

The place is well maintained and organized. I enjoy that one is able to make conversation and joke without being judged. Rob has been my barber for several years now. I've been to many place in my lifetime and by far this has been the best! I am proud to say I am a loyal customer to Active Barbers. Thanks fellas for always making your customers feel like close friends. ""OhSaySuuuuumm!"" The infamous line at the shop."
5/22/14,0.346606908,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,I walked in and luckily Gabriel was available. He asked what I wanted to do with my hair and all I said was that I wanted the sides nice and tight and to blend well with the top. I honestly had a long day so I guess I didn't really know what I wanted but I kinda left it up to him. I just needed a fresh clean cut. Gabriel had delivered an amazing taper fade and trimmed the top of my hair hella good. He delivered a haircut that had amazed me. I really appreciate that he really takes pride in what he does and that he did what looked best. The entire staff was very friendly and the place was very clean. Yhanks again Gabriel and even though I don't live in the area I will be back soon. If you are looking for a nice cut I would recommend Gabriel.

There were 3 barbers working, and luckily Chris' chair was free and I was next. I've been coming to him ever since for the past few months. I'm very picky with my hair - he always accommodates and never does anything you don't ask him to. Go see Chris!"

10/29/14,0.368333333,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Found this gem in Santa Monica a couple of months ago. Been going to Robert for the past 3 haircuts. Great cuts each time. Robert is very fast and precise with the clippers. Never a hair out of place when I get home. Went in today to find out it was Robert's day off. Megan cut my hair and did an awesome job. She took her time and proved she knows her way around the clippers and scissors. I now have 2 options when I stop in though I have a feeling all of the staff here are masters of their craft. This place never disappoints. Bonus points for opening at 7am. Extra bonus points for the $20 price which on the Westside is a bargain.
5/19/15,0.172222222,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I've been wary of barbershops... haircuts have honestly been one of my least favorite things in life. Finding a place with great prices and quality cuts has been a serious problem - until Active Barbers. This place is the best by far on the Westside for quality and price. I get cut by Chris, who's more or less the man. I can't recommend him and this place enough. Ditch whatever chain you've been going to and find a seat here."
7/13/15,0.066666667,Positive,0,1.0 star rating,1,The worst haircut I've ever gotten. The barber asked me what kind of cut I wanted and I showed him and he proceeded to ask me in and irate manner what kind of cut on a 1 - 10 scale but refused to explain the scale.
5/19/15,0.284532967,Positive,0,3.0 star rating,3,Love Active Barbers! I go and see Chris weekly and highly recommend him.  The entire shop is awesome tho; great vibe - everyone's very friendly.  Very old school feel.  When I moved out here from the east coast it was definitely difficult to find somewhere that's affordable to get a nice tight shave/beard line up - but Active and Chris are both awesome!
8/21/14,0.219949495,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"I grow my hair out for 12-18 months, I get tired of it, I cut it all off, I start over. Today was time for my cut. I like trying out new places each time, so Active got the nod. Glad I found this place. Those of us who like a simple buzz with the #2 blade know that not every buzz is created equal - plenty of people miss a hair or five here and there, can't line it up properly, or don't really know how to make this simplest of cuts look great. Robert hooked it all up. I was in and out in about 20 minutes, but it was enough time to feel comfortable, check out some sports highlights and get an excellent cut.Good vibe in the place and from the guys there. I might have to hold off on trying new places for a while."

8/16/14,0.466666667,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,Cut was really good and the atmosphere was what a barber shop should be. Having just moved here I was a concerned about finding a good place. But looks like I don't have to look anymore. Will definitely go back.

I am very pleased with my haircut and have now found my new barber. They are all TOP NOTCH and for the price and quality they provide you are not gonna find anywhere else that's better.

7/5/15,0.369117647,Positive,0,5.0 star rating,5,"Best barbershop on the west side of town! Steven and Robert (co-owners) are two very talented master barbers as well the rest of the crew Meagan, Armando and Chris are all great. My personal barber is Steven I've been going to him since he started his barbering career never once has he disappointed me, my 2 year old son loves him, he's been going to Steven as well since he started getting hair cuts, he even asks for me to take him with Steven to get a hair cut and then buy him a gum ball from their gum ball machine. The shop can get very busy at times so appointments are always highly suggested (24hrs in advance) but if you don't mind waiting they always have two other barbers taking walk ins. The shop has such a mellow and welcoming vibe there's always great and most of the time hilarious conversations going on between barbers and customers makes your wait time feel not so long. They also have three tvs that no matter where u sit u have a good view and they even change the channel to whatever you want to watch if you ask them too. (Comes in handy when u have kids and cartoons keep them entertained) I would recommend this barbershop for anyone looking for a 5star haircut without the arm and a leg prices these guys are truly the best at their craft check them out!"

The barbers, Steven, Robert, and Gabriel are all certified professionals who have mastered their craft. Their knowledge in the art of cutting gentleman's hair is one to applaud. I personally have been getting my haircuts with Steven for over eight years. His service and his cuts have never been short of phenomenal. If you're in the area and looking to get a haircut that you want to be completely satisfied with, stop by active barbers and schedule an appointment with either of these guys. You won't be disappointed."

I go to Steve who is one of the owners and since day 1 he was able to get my haircut EXACTLY how I wanted. He's truly passionate about the art of cutting hair and that's hard to find nowadays. There's no comparison to any of the other 5 star barbers in the area. Rest assured when going here, you will definitely leave happy!"

His attention to detail and strive for perfection set him apart from the other barbers. When he opened his own spot none of his skills were compromised. Every time I get a cut he adapts to find the best possible cut. Whats nice is he tells you what hes doing and he incorporates (and remembers) feedback.Robert's new place is awesome, next time you visit ask for a beer."

The guy (short, beard, Latino, stocky) cut my hair looked very paranoid and he had an attitude, it not my fault FAM!! It's not my fault!! Very unprofessional I must say. I sat down and straight up asked what hair cut did I want, I answered "" low fade, a 4 on top and a line up"" pretty simple, right? Well I should've went to SUPERCUTS!!! He was extremely rough, like he was angry, and finished the haircut within seconds, he hands me the mirror and no line up!! REALLY BRUH!! Maybe if you would've LISTENED you would've done an ok job!!!!!! Maybe if you stop being so paranoid and once again LISTEN!!! And to top it off, when I told him to line up the front he rolled his eyes as if this bullshit as haircut was free!! FUCK OUTTA HERE!!! This is not the hood nor the ghetto, I'm sure you are but this is a place of business and a little professionalism wouldn't hurt. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS SO CALLED BARBERSHOP TO ANYONE!!"

Was hooked up by Robert who gave me a sick fade and styled my newly grown out hair. These guys are awesome and showed me some great west coast hospitality.
