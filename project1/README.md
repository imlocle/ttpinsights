### Objective

To some, barbershops may seem like a thing of the past. However, with the ubiquity of the hipster movement: edgy hairstyles, beards and whisky, a resurgence of barbershops is occurring throughout the states.  By 2020, the industry is estimated to reach $26B and many barbershops, salons and men's grooming centers are trying to find their space within this growing market. 

Our goal for this project is to develop a barber shop recommender system based on demographics and yelp reviews. We'll create actionable insights that local barbers can use to grow and improve their businesses.

Data will be collected through an online survey, yelp and google api(s). 

We'll utilize Python to scrape, clean and organize our data.

Our datasets will then be used to train a predictive model in R and Python.

We'll display our predictions through a dynamic, interactive Shiny Dashboard.

    * The importance of price, convenience, atmosphere and products.
    * The average price spent on haircuts.
